Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",

The tour began in Homestead, Florida, in mid October 1973, and ended in Northampton, England, in late November. Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education. England; the rest of the tour was cancelled due to heavy snow. during the tour, some crucial bob marley and the wailers <Event> recordings </Event> had been made; the appearance at the capitol studios had been videotaped and has been <Event> used </Event> for several documentary movies. The appearance at Sausalito's Record Plant had been broadcast live by KSAN and later officially released on the album \"Talkin' Blues\".

The tour began in Homestead, Florida, in mid October 1973, and ended in Northampton, England, in late November. Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education. England; the rest of the tour was cancelled due to heavy snow. during the tour, some crucial bob marley and the wailers <Event> recordings </Event> had been made; the appearance at the capitol studios had been videotaped and has been <Event> used </Event> for several documentary movies. The appearance at Sausalito's Record Plant had been broadcast live by KSAN and later officially released on the album \"Talkin' Blues\". Furthermore, the appearances at BBC's Top of the Pops and at Leeds University had been recorded as well and later were officially released on the second disc of the deluxe edition of the \"Burnin'\" album.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> recordings </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> used </Event>\n",

On the night of 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (part of the 7th Motor Brigade), with thirteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns and the 239th Battery, 76th Anti-Tank Regiment RA, with six more 6-pounders, was <Event> ordered </Event> to occupy a desert feature known as Snipe, a small depression in the landscape south-west of Kidney Ridge that was suitable for an outpost. Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",

Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education.

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

On the night of 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (part of the 7th Motor Brigade), with thirteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns and the 239th Battery, 76th Anti-Tank Regiment RA, with six more 6-pounders, was <Event> ordered </Event> to occupy a desert feature known as Snipe, a small depression in the landscape south-west of Kidney Ridge that was suitable for an outpost. Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",

Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education.
