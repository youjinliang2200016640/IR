Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

The tour began in Homestead, Florida, in mid October 1973, and ended in Northampton, England, in late November. Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education.

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education.

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",

Before: The earthquake occurred on April 20, 2010, at approximately 8:17 am WST. The fact that no one was killed but two people were treated at Kalgoorlie Hospital for minor injuries resulting from the earthquake occurred after the earthquake, which means that the relation type \"before\" exists between the two events/Timexes.

The tour began in Homestead, Florida, in mid October 1973, and ended in Northampton, England, in late November. Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education. England; the rest of the tour was cancelled due to heavy snow. during the tour, some crucial bob marley and the wailers <Event> recordings </Event> had been made; the appearance at the capitol studios had been videotaped and has been <Event> used </Event> for several documentary movies. The appearance at Sausalito's Record Plant had been broadcast live by KSAN and later officially released on the album \"Talkin' Blues\". Furthermore, the appearances at BBC's Top of the Pops and at Leeds University had been recorded as well and later were officially released on the second disc of the deluxe edition of the \"Burnin'\" album.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> recordings </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> used </Event>\n",

The document also mentions that the appearance at Capitol studios was videotaped and has been used for documentary movies. This suggests that the recordings were made during the tour and were used after the tour.\n\nBased on this information, I can infer that the first event (recordings) is before the second event (used).

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

The tour began in Homestead, Florida, in mid October 1973, and ended in Northampton, England, in late November. Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education.

On the night of 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (part of the 7th Motor Brigade), with thirteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns and the 239th Battery, 76th Anti-Tank Regiment RA, with six more 6-pounders, was <Event> ordered </Event> to occupy a desert feature known as Snipe, a small depression in the landscape south-west of Kidney Ridge that was suitable for an outpost. Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",

The tour began in Homestead, Florida, in mid October 1973, and ended in Northampton, England, in late November. Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education. England; the rest of the tour was cancelled due to heavy snow. during the tour, some crucial bob marley and the wailers <Event> recordings </Event> had been made; the appearance at the capitol studios had been videotaped and has been <Event> used </Event> for several documentary movies. The appearance at Sausalito's Record Plant had been broadcast live by KSAN and later officially released on the album \"Talkin' Blues\".

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

Bunny Wailer, who had not participated in the American leg of the Catch a Fire Tour, was replaced by Joe Higgs. The first four shows of the second tour leg in England had been cancelled due to Tosh's illness. The tour ended in Northampton,at the Northampton College of further education.
