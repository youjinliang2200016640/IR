The battle took place in 1813, and it is likely that the human being was born sometime before that.\n\nUsing world knowledge, we can look up the War of 1812 and find that it was fought between the United States and Great Britain from 1812 to 1815. We can also look up the Battle of Frenchtown, which took place on January 22, 1813, near the present-day city of Monroe, Michigan.\n\nGiven that the battle took place in Michigan and that the human being was killed leading his men at the battle, it is likely that the human being was born in the United States, possibly in the Great Lakes region or the Midwest. However, without further information, we cannot pinpoint the exact place of birth.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Which place was this human being born?\" is:\n\n* It is not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nNote: This answer is based on the assumption that the human being was born in the United States, as the passage only provides information about the county being named after the human being and does not provide any information about the human being's birthplace.",

Then we created questions related to the anonymized entity in each passage.\n\nThe QA-MRC dataset consists of 100 news articles from the BBC and CNN websites.\n\n### Overall Dataset Stats\n\nNumber of Documents = 100\n\nNumber of Questions = 224\n\nNumber of Answers = 281\n\n### Dataset Format\n\nThe QA-MRC dataset consists of a set of JSON files in the directory `data`.\n\nHere is an example of one JSON file `0000000000000001.json`.\n\n{\n    \"id\": \"0000000000000001\",\n    \"passage\": {\n        \"text\": \"The [anonymized entity] economy shrank by 7.9% in the first quarter of 2020[.]The global outlook for economic growth this year is a [anonymized event] of 3%[.]\",\n        \"entities\": {\n            \"entity_1\": \"The [anonymized entity] economy\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"questions\": [\n        {\n            \"question\": \"What is the GDP of the [anonymized entity]?\",\n            \"id\": \"0000000000000001_question_1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"question\": \"What is the GDP of the [anonymized entity]?\",\n            \"id\": \"0000000000000001_question_2\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answers\": [\n        {\n            \"answer\": \"2.1 trillion\",\n            \"id\": \"0000000000000001_answer_1\",\n            \"question\": \"0000000000000001_question_1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"answer\": \"2.1 trillion\",\n            \"id\": \"0000000000000001_answer_2\",\n            \"question\": \"0000000000000001_question_2\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n### Questions\n\nEach document has one or more questions related to the anonymized entity in the document.\n\n### Answers\n\nEach document has one or more answers to the questions in the document.\n\n### Documents\n\nEach document consists of a passage and a list of entities.\n\n### Entities\n\nEach document consists of a list of entities.
