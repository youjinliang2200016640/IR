governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",

governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n",
