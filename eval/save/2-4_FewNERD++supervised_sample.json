The new car manufacturer\n   - Type: Company/Business\n   - Description: This entity refers to a company that specializes in the production of cars.\n\n2. Electric vehicle(s)\n   - Type: Product\n   - Description: This entity refers to a category of cars that are powered by electricity.\n\n3. Engine(s)\n   - Type: Part/Component\n   - Description: This entity refers to the internal combustion engine that powers the vehicles.\n   - Note: Engines are typically classified as machines that convert one form of energy (fuel, for example) to another through combustion or similar processes.\n\n4. Accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds\n   - Type: Action\n   - Description: This entity refers to the capability of the engines to rapidly accelerate the vehicle from a complete stop to 60 mph in less than three seconds.\n\n5. Reach a top speed of 150 mph\n   - Type: Event/Action\n   - Description: This entity refers to the maximum velocity the vehicles can attain before reaching a plateau.\n\nAs you can see, the types of entities and events are quite specific and have a clear focus on the features and capabilities of the cars. The types do not have predefined boundaries as they depend on the specific context of the fictitious text.
