Count the number of CDPs that meet both criteria.\n\nStep 1: Identify the CDPs with a population over 5700.\nResearching and gathering data on CDPs with a population over 5700 is a time-consuming process, and without a specific list, it would be challenging to provide an accurate answer. However, there are many CDPs in the United States that meet this criteria.\n\nStep 2: Identify the CDP where Herbert Hoover resided.\nHerbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States, had multiple residences throughout his life. One of his primary residences during his presidency was in Washington, D.C., which is a city, not a CDP.\n\nStep 3: Determine if there are any overlaps between the two lists.\nSince Washington, D.C. is a city and not a CDP, there is no overlap between the two lists.\n\nStep 4: Count the number of CDPs that meet both criteria.\nSince none of the CDPs with a population over 5700 are the residence of Herbert Hoover, the answer is zero (0).",

The populations of CDPs can change over time, and some might have been incorporated into larger cities or merged with nearby communities. For the sake of providing an answer, let's consider the CDP where he was born, West Branch, as a potential candidate.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the population of West Branch, Iowa, as of the 2010 census, was approximately 6,500. This is over 5,700, so we can say that at least one CDP with a population over 5,700 is associated with Herbert Hoover.\n\nAs for other residential places, we would need a comprehensive dataset that tracks the exact addresses and populations of CDPs associated with Hoover throughout his life.
