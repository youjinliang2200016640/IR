The populations of CDPs can change over time, and some might have been incorporated into larger cities or merged with nearby communities. For the sake of providing an answer, let's consider the CDP where he was born, West Branch, as a potential candidate.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the population of West Branch, Iowa, as of the 2010 census, was approximately 6,500. This is over 5,700, so we can say that at least one CDP with a population over 5,700 is associated with Herbert Hoover.\n\nAs for other residential places, we would need a comprehensive dataset that tracks the exact addresses and populations of CDPs associated with Hoover throughout his life.
