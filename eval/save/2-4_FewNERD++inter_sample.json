Heath\n- Sean O'Brien\n- Robert Curl\n- Richard Smalley\n- Buckminsterfullerene (C60)\n\nClassification:\n1. Entities: Each of the names is referring to a specific individual:\n   - Harold Kroto: Nobel Prize-winning chemist and physicist who studied fullerene-like compounds.\n   - James R. Heath: Physicist who worked on spectroscopy and fullerene research.\n   - Sean O'Brien: Physicist who studied the electronic structure of fullerene-like compounds.\n   - Robert Curl: Nobel Prize-winning chemist who worked on fullerenes and other aromatic compounds.\n   - Richard Smalley: Co-discoverer of fullerenes (also known as buckminsterfullerene, or C60) with his research group at Rice University.\n\n2. Buckminsterfullerene (C60): This is the formal name for a class of carbon-based molecules with a fullerene structure.\n\nThe types can be:\n- Entities: Individual humans.\n- Buckminsterfullerene (C60): A specific substance, an example of a physical entity.\n\nFor a more detailed classification, the provided text could be categorized as follows:\n\n- Biological entities: None of the individuals mentioned (except for Richard Smalley) are biological.\n- Physical entities: Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is a physical entity. The individuals mentioned are associated with the discovery of fullerenes, which are also physical objects.\n\nIn summary, the provided text mentions five entities: individuals working together at Rice University, and the substance Buckminsterfullerene (C60).
