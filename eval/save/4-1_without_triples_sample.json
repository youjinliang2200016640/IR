Batts reported that , contrary to department policy , the officers did not secure him inside the van while driving to the police station ; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Gray 's arrest , following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city , and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years .The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport .The medical examiner 's office concluded that Gray 's death could not be ruled an accident , and was instead a homicide , because officers failed to follow safety procedures `` through acts of omission .

            "actual_output": "The Thirty Years' War was a religious and political conflict that took place primarily in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648. It was one of the most destructive conflicts in human history, resulting in eight million fatalities not only from military engagements but also from violence, famine, and plague. Casualties were overwhelmingly and disproportionately inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire, most of the rest being battle deaths from various foreign armies.\n\nThe deadly clashes ravaged Europe; 20 percent of the total population of Germany died during the conflict, and there were losses up to 50 percent in a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest. In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction, it was surpassed only by the period January to May 1945. One of its enduring results was 19th-century Pan-Germanism, when it served as an example of the dangers of a divided Germany and became a key justification for the 1871 creation of the German Empire (although it excluded the German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire).\n\nInitially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the European great powers. These states employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France\u2013Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence.\n\nThe war was preceded by the election of the new Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains, forcing Roman Catholicism on its peoples. The northern Protestant states, angered by the violation of their rights to religious liberty, which had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg, banded together to form the Protestant Union. Ferdinand II was a devout Roman Catholic and much less tolerant than his predecessor, Rudolf II, who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague. Ferdinand's policies were considered strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant. These events caused widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe, and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria (and also with the Holy Roman Empire) to revolt against their nominal ruler, Ferdinand II. ",
            "expected_output": "After the so-called Defenestration of Prague deposed the Emperor 's representatives in Prague , the Protestant estates and Catholic Habsburgs started gathering allies for war .The Protestant Bohemians ousted the Habsburgs and elected the Calvinist Frederick V , Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate as the new king of the Kingdom of Bohemia .Frederick took the offer without the support of the Protestant Union .The southern states , mainly Roman Catholic , were angered by this .Led by Bavaria , these states formed the Catholic League to expel Frederick in support of the Emperor .The Empire soon crushed the perceived Protestant rebellion in the Battle of White Mountain , executing leading Bohemian aristocrats shortly after .Protestant rulers across Europe unanimously condemned the Emperor 's action .After the atrocities committed in Bohemia , Saxony finally gave its support to the Protestant Union and decided to fight back .Sweden , at the time a rising military power , soon intervened in 1630 under its king Gustavus Adolphus , transforming what had been simply the Emperor 's attempt to curb the Protestant states into a full-scale war in Europe .",

The Entente strategy was to conduct offensives from north to south, beginning with an attack by the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) then the main attack by two French army groups on the Aisne.\n\nGeneral Robert Nivelle, the new Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, planned the offensive in December 1916. The objective of the attack on the Aisne was to capture the prominent, east\u2013west ridge of the Chemin des Dames, north-east of Paris, and then advance northwards to capture the city of Laon. When the French armies met the British advancing from the Arras front, the Germans would be pursued towards Belgium and the German frontier.\n\nThe offensive began on April 9, when the British began the Battle of Arras. On April 16, the German Reserve Army Group attacked the Chemin des Dames, and the next day, the Fourth Army, part of the Central Army Group, began the Battle of the Hills near Reims to the south-east.\n\nThe Battle of the Aisne was a difficult and costly battle for both sides, with high casualties on both sides. The French and British forces made some gains, but were ultimately unable to achieve a decisive victory. The battle marked a turning point in the war, as it demonstrated the increasing stalemate on the Western Front and the inability of either side to achieve a decisive victory. It also foreshadowed the eventual transition to trench warfare and the development of new tactics and technologies, such as tanks and gas warfare, in the final years of the war. ",

            "input": "\nThe Thirty Years ' War was a war fought primarily in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648 .One of the most destructive conflicts in human history , it resulted in eight million fatalities not only from military engagements but also from violence , famine , and plague .Casualties were overwhelmingly and disproportionately inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire , most of the rest being battle deaths from various foreign armies .The deadly clashes ravaged Europe ; 20 percent of the total population of Germany died during the conflict and there were losses up to 50 percent in a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest .In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction , it was surpassed only by the period January to May 1945 ; one of its enduring results was 19th-century Pan-Germanism , when it served as an example of the dangers of a divided Germany and became a key justification for the 1871 creation of the German Empire ( although it excluded the German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire ) .Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire , it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the European great powers .These states employed relatively large mercenary armies , and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France\u2013Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence .The war was preceded by the election of the new Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor , Ferdinand II , who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains , forcing Roman Catholicism on its peoples .The northern Protestant states , angered by the violation of their rights to religious liberty , which had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg , banded together to form the Protestant Union .Ferdinand II was a devout Roman Catholic and much less tolerant than his predecessor , Rudolf II , who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague .Ferdinand 's policies were considered strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant .These events caused widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe , and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria ( and also with the Holy Roman Empire ) to revolt against their nominal ruler , Ferdinand II .",
            "actual_output": " The Thirty Years' War was a long-lasting conflict that took place in Central Europe from 1618 to 1648. It was one of the most destructive conflicts in human history, with an estimated total loss of around eight million lives. This number includes not only the fatalities from military engagements but also from violence, famine, and plague.\n\nThe casualties were overwhelmingly suffered by the population of the Holy Roman Empire, which at the time was a collection of mostly independent and often weak states. The vast majority of the rest were battle-related deaths of soldiers from various foreign armies. The war's devastating clashes rampaged through Europe, causing massive population losses. In Germany, for example, about 20 percent of the total population died during the conflict, with losses in the corridor region between Pomerania and the Black Forest reaching as high as 50 percent.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War was one of the most significant historical events in the development of modern Germany. It had a profound impact on the future shape of that country, contributing to the rise and fall of various political entities and laying the foundation for the development of modern German identity and borders. The war was a significant event that contributed to the rise of Pan-Germanism in the 19th century, as Germans rallied around the idea of a unified nation-state to counter the chaos and disorder of the conflict.\n\nOne of the most significant historical outcomes of the Thirty Years' War was the creation of the German Empire in 1871. This event marked the culmination of the Pan-Germanist movement and the unification of most of the German-speaking lands under one banner, although it excluded the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was predominantly German-speaking as well. This empire was headed by the House of Hohenzollern and was a continuation of the dynastic rivalry between France and the Habsburgs, which had been exacerbated by the Thirty Years' War.",
            "expected_output": "After the so-called Defenestration of Prague deposed the Emperor 's representatives in Prague , the Protestant estates and Catholic Habsburgs started gathering allies for war .The Protestant Bohemians ousted the Habsburgs and elected the Calvinist Frederick V , Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate as the new king of the Kingdom of Bohemia .Frederick took the offer without the support of the Protestant Union .The southern states , mainly Roman Catholic , were angered by this .Led by Bavaria , these states formed the Catholic League to expel Frederick in support of the Emperor .The Empire soon crushed the perceived Protestant rebellion in the Battle of White Mountain , executing leading Bohemian aristocrats shortly after .Protestant rulers across Europe unanimously condemned the Emperor 's action .After the atrocities committed in Bohemia , Saxony finally gave its support to the Protestant Union and decided to fight back .Sweden , at the time a rising military power , soon intervened in 1630 under its king Gustavus Adolphus , transforming what had been simply the Emperor 's attempt to curb the Protestant states into a full-scale war in Europe .",

            "actual_output": "  The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) was a devastating conflict that ravaged Central Europe, resulting in eight million fatalities and widespread destruction. It was one of the most destructive wars in human history, with casualties disproportionately affecting the Holy Roman Empire and its inhabitants. The war began as a religious conflict between Protestant and Catholic states within the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, but eventually evolved into a broader struggle for European political dominance.\n\nThe war was sparked by the election of Ferdinand II as the new Holy Roman Emperor, who sought to impose religious uniformity on his domains and force Roman Catholicism on his peoples. This led to the formation of the Protestant Union, a coalition of northern Protestant states angered by the violation of their rights to religious liberty. Ferdinand's policies were seen as strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant, leading to widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe.\n\nThe war had a profound impact on the political and social landscape of Europe. It led to the rise of Pan-Germanism, a movement that advocated for the unification of all German-speaking territories under a single state.

India retaliated with a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan, leading to intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nThe war saw the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II, with thousands of soldiers and civilians killed or injured on both sides. The conflict also saw the use of air power, with both countries deploying fighter jets and bombers in support of their ground forces.\n\nThe war was fought primarily in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan, with both sides launching offensives and counter-offensives in an attempt to gain the upper hand. The conflict was marked by intense fighting and brutal tactics, including the use of artillery and aerial bombing, as well as the involvement of local militias and tribal forces.\n\nThe war ended with a United Nations-mandated ceasefire, which was negotiated following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States. The Tashkent Declaration, issued in September 1965, brought an end to the hostilities and called for the withdrawal of troops from Kashmir and the establishment of a ceasefire line.\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 had significant consequences for both countries and the region as a whole. The war led to a significant increase in tensions between India and Pakistan, and the two countries continued to engage in skirmishes and border clashes in the following years.

The Thirty Years ' War was a war fought primarily in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648. One of the most destructive conflicts in human history, it resulted in eight million fatalities not only from military engagements but also from violence, famine, and plague. Casualties were overwhelmingly and disproportionately inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire, most of the rest being battle deaths from various foreign armies. The deadly clashes ravaged Europe; 20 percent of the total population of Germany died during the conflict and there were losses up to 50 percent in a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest. In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction, it was surpassed only by the period January to May 1945; one of its enduring results was 19th-century Pan-Germanism, when it served as an example of the dangers of a divided Germany and became a key justification for the 1871 creation of the German Empire (although it excluded the German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire). Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the European great powers. These states employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France\u2013Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence. The war was preceded by the election of the new Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains, forcing Roman Catholicism on its peoples. The northern Protestant states, angered by the violation of their rights to religious liberty, which had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg, banded together to form the Protestant Union. Ferdinand II was a devout Roman Catholic and much less tolerant than his predecessor, Rudolf II, who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague. Ferdinand's policies were considered strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant. These events caused widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe, and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria (and also with the Holy Roman Empire) to revolt against their nominal ruler, Ferdinand II. After the so-called Defenestration of Prague in 1618, the Protestant estates and Catholic Habsburgs started a struggle for the throne. This also marked the beginning of the Bohemian Revolt. The conflict spread when the Protestant Union (an alliance of Protestant German states) sided with the Bohemians. The Habsburgs, who ruled Spain as well as Austria, then called in the aid of their Catholic allies from all over Europe to put down the rebellion. The war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France\u2013Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence. The Thirty Years' War devastated entire regions, with famine and disease significantly decreasing the populations of the German and Italian states, the Low Countries and Bohemia. The disease and famine decreased the population of the Holy Roman Empire from 21 million in 1618 to 13.5 million by 1650. In the 21st century, historians regard the war as one of the most important events in European history. The Peace of Westphalia, which brought the war to an end in 1648, established the precedent of peace decided by a congress of nations and a new system of political order in central Europe. The Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties had further weakened themselves by fighting expensive wars with each other and against the Ottoman Empire. The Habsburgs, who remained Catholic, were less powerful than they had been, but the Austrian branch remained the dominant power in central Europe; the Bourbons, who remained Catholic, expanded their influence at the expense of the Habsburgs. With the having lost their Spanish and Bohemian holdings, the Habsburgs continued to be a formidable power in central Europe and Hungary.\nTags: The Thirty Years War",

            "actual_output": "  The Thirty Years War was a devastating conflict that lasted from 1618 to 1648 and involved various European powers, including the Holy Roman Empire, Protestant states, and Catholic states. The war resulted in an estimated eight million fatalities, with the majority being civilians who died from violence, famine, and plague. The conflict began as a war between Protestant and Catholic states in the Holy Roman Empire, but it eventually evolved into a broader conflict involving most European great powers, who employed large mercenary armies.\n\nThe war was triggered by the election of Ferdinand II as the new Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, who attempted to impose religious uniformity on his domains by forcing Roman Catholicism on its peoples. This violated the rights to religious liberty granted in the Peace of Augsburg, leading the northern Protestant states to form the Protestant Union in response. Ferdinand II was seen as a devout Roman Catholic who was less tolerant than his predecessor, Rudolf II, who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague.\n\nThe Protestant Bohemians, who lived in the relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria and the Holy Roman Empire, revolted against Ferdinand II's policies, which were perceived as strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant. This rebellion sparked the broader conflict that eventually involved most European great powers, including France, Sweden, and Denmark. The war became less about religion and more about a continuation of the France-Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence.\n\nThe Thirty Years War had a profound impact on Europe, leading to the deaths of millions of people and widespread destruction. The war also had lasting consequences for the political and religious landscape of Europe, contributing to the rise of Pan-Germanism in the 19th century and the eventual creation of the German Empire in 1871. The war remains one of the deadliest conflicts in human history, with its legacy still felt today.",

The offensive was planned by General Robert Nivelle, who had replaced Joseph Joffre as the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in December 1916. The main objective of the offensive was to inflict a decisive defeat on the German armies in France and to capture the strategic Chemin des Dames ridge, which ran east-west north-east of Paris.\n\nThe offensive began on April 9, 1917, with the British launching the Battle of Arras, which was part of the larger Nivelle Offensive. On April 16, the French Reserve Army Group (GAR) attacked the Chemin des Dames, while the Fourth Army, part of the Central Army Group (GAC), began the Battle of the Hills near Reims to the south-east. The French armies were tasked with capturing the Chemin des Dames ridge and then advancing northwards to capture the city of Laon. The British were to advance from the Arras front and meet the French armies, trapping the Germans between them and forcing them towards Belgium and the German frontier.\n\nThe Second Battle of the Aisne was one of the bloodiest battles of World War I, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Despite initial gains, the offensive ultimately failed to achieve its strategic objectives, and the French and British armies were forced to retreat. The failure of the Nivelle Offensive led to widespread mutinies in the French Army, and General Nivelle was replaced by General Philippe P\u00e9tain, who implemented a more cautious and defensive strategy for the remainder of the war.",

India responded by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan.\n\nThe war saw intense fighting between the two countries, with thousands of casualties on both sides.

The conflict ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared, following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.\n\nThe majority of the fighting took place on land, with battles being fought in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan. The war was a significant turning point in the history of the region, and it had far-reaching consequences for the relationship between India and Pakistan. It also led to a greater focus on military preparedness and defense strategies for both countries.\n\nThe Tashkent Declaration, signed on January 10, 1966, was a joint statement issued by India and Pakistan, with the mediation of the Soviet Union and the United States. It called for the establishment of a peaceful and friendly relationship between the two countries, and the resolution of disputes through peaceful means. It also established the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, which remains a contentious issue to this day.\n\nOverall, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a significant conflict that highlighted the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.

            "actual_output": "  The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) was a devastating conflict that ravaged Central Europe, causing immense human suffering and destruction. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in European history, resulting in an estimated eight million fatalities, including both military battles and civilian casualties. The war primarily affected the inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire, with around 20% of the German population dying during the conflict. In some areas, such as a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest, losses reached as high as 50%.\nInitially, the war was a conflict between various Protestant and Catholic states within the fragmented Holy Roman Empire. However, it soon evolved into a larger conflict involving most of the European great powers. These states employed large mercenary armies, which contributed to the war's destructive nature. The war was no longer solely about religion but became a continuation of the France-Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence.\nThe war was preceded by the election of Ferdinand II as the new Holy Roman Emperor, who sought to impose religious uniformity on his domains. This move angered the northern Protestant states, which had previously been granted religious liberty in the Peace of Augsburg. In response, the Protestant states formed the Protestant Union. Ferdinand II was a devout Catholic and less tolerant than his predecessor, Rudolf II, who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague.\nThe fears and tensions that led to the war were not limited to the Holy Roman Empire. The Protestant Bohemians living in Habsburg Austria, which was a relatively loose dominion of the Holy Roman Empire, also revolted against their nominal ruler, Ferdinand II.\nThe Thirty Years War had significant long-term consequences. It led to the 19th-century Pan-Germanism movement, which highlighted the dangers of a divided Germany. The war also became a key justification for the creation of the German Empire in 1871, excluding the German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire.\nIn conclusion, the Thirty Years War was a devastating conflict that had far-reaching consequences for Central Europe and the European political landscape. Its impact on the German-speaking regions was particularly significant, shaping the course of German history for centuries to come.",

            "actual_output": "The Thirty Years' War was a devastating conflict that ravaged Central Europe from 1618 to 1648, resulting in approximately eight million fatalities. The war was fought primarily between Protestant and Catholic states within the Holy Roman Empire, but it eventually involved most of the major European powers. The conflict was sparked by the election of Ferdinand II, a Catholic, as the Holy Roman Emperor, who sought to impose religious uniformity on his domains. This led to the formation of the Protestant Union, and the war escalated into a broader conflict involving mercenary armies and France-Habsburg rivalry for European dominance.\n\nThe war had a disproportionate impact on the population of the Holy Roman Empire, with 20% of Germany's total population dying during the conflict. There were also significant losses in a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest, with some areas experiencing losses of up to 50%. The war's devastating effects helped to shape 19th-century Pan-Germanism, which emphasized the importance of German unity and served as a justification for the creation of the German Empire in 1871.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War was initially a religious conflict, but it eventually became more of a power struggle between European great powers. The war was marked by widespread violence, famine, and plague, and its legacy continues to be felt to this day. The conflict's impact on European history was significant, and it played a major role in shaping the continent's political and religious landscape.",

The war started as a conflict between Protestant and Catholic states in the Holy Roman Empire but gradually escalated into a general conflict involving most of the European powers. The war was fought using large mercenary armies, and it became more about political rivalry between France and the Habsburgs than about religion. The war was preceded by the election of Ferdinand II, who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains and was considered pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant. This led to widespread fears and the Protestant Bohemians to revolt against Ferdinand II.

This was seen as a violation of India's sovereignty and led to India's retaliation by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan.\nThe war was characterized by heavy fighting between the two countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border.

It was one of the most destructive conflicts in human history, with an estimated eight million fatalities resulting from military engagements, violence, famine, and plague.\n\nThe war started as a conflict between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, but it gradually evolved into a broader struggle involving most of the European great powers. The states involved employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more about the rivalry between France and the Habsburgs for European political dominance.\n\nThe war was triggered by the election of a new Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains, forcing Roman Catholicism on its inhabitants. This led to widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe, and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria to revolt against their nominal ruler, Ferdinand II.\n\nIn terms of casualties, the war was devastating, with an estimated 20% of the total population of Germany dying during the conflict, and losses of up to 50% in some areas. It had a lasting impact on the region, including the rise of 19th-century Pan-Germanism, which was fueled by the desire to avoid a divided Germany and became a key justification for the creation of the German Empire in 1871.",

The war was primarily fought between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, but it eventually evolved into a more general conflict involving most of the major European powers.\nThe war was preceded by the election of Ferdinand II as the new Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains by forcing Roman Catholicism on its peoples. This led to the northern Protestant states banded together to form the Protestant Union in protest against the violation of their rights to religious liberty, which had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg.\nFerdinand II was a devout Roman Catholic and was much less tolerant than his predecessor, Rudolf II, who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague. Ferdinand's policies were considered strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant, which led to widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria to revolt against their nominal ruler, Ferdinand II.\nThe war had a devastating impact on Europe, with 20 percent of the total population of Germany dying during the conflict and losses up to 50 percent in a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest. It was the most destructive conflict in German history and had a lasting impact on the region, leading to the rise of Pan-Germanism and the eventual creation of the German Empire in 1871.",

The attack began on 9 April, with the British launching the Battle of Arras. Two days later, on 16 April, the Reserve Army Group (GAR) attacked the Chemin des Dames, while the Fourth Army, part of Central Army Group (GAC), began the Battle of the Hills to the south-east.\nThe offensive was met with stiff resistance from the Germans, and the Allied advance was slow. The weather was also poor, with heavy rain and mud hindering the movement of troops and supplies. The offensive continued until mid-May, but despite the efforts of the Allies, they were not able to achieve their objectives.\nThe Second Battle of the Aisne was a costly failure for the Allies. The attack resulted in heavy casualties, and the offensive was not successful in achieving its objectives.

Germany suffered a devastating 20% population loss during the war, with some regions like Pomerania and the Black Forest experiencing up to 50% loss.\n\nInitially, it was a religious conflict between Protestant and Catholic states within the Holy Roman Empire, but it expanded to involve major European powers, turning into a broader struggle for political dominance. Mercenary armies were prevalent, and the war's motivations evolved from religious differences to a proxy fight between France and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nFerdinand II, the newly elected Holy Roman Emperor, sought to enforce religious uniformity by imposing Catholicism, which led to the Protestant Union's formation in opposition. Ferdinand, being a devout Catholic and less tolerant than his predecessor, Rudolf II,\u89e6\u53d1ed a rebellion among Protestant Bohemians in the Habsburg territories, including the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThis conflict had significant long-term consequences, including the fostering of 19th-century Pan-Germanism and the eventual unification of Germany in 1871, with the exclusion of some German-speaking regions under the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg Empire. The war served as a cautionary tale about the dangers of a divided Germany and contributed to the justification for its territorial expansion.",

            "actual_output": "The Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Nivelle Offensive, was a significant military campaign during World War I that took place from April 16 to mid-May 1917. The primary goal of this offensive was to deal a decisive blow to the German forces in France, as part of the broader strategy of the Entente (France and the United Kingdom) to push back the enemy and regain territory.\n\nGeneral Robert Nivelle, who replaced Joseph Joffre as the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, planned the offensive meticulously in December 1916. The strategy involved launching a series of attacks, starting with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in the north and then followed by coordinated French army groups attacking the Aisne River valley.\n\nThe primary objective of the offensive on the Aisne was to capture the strategically important Chemin des Dames, an east-west ridge located northeast of Paris. This would have allowed the French to gain a commanding position and advance northward towards Laon, forcing the Germans to retreat and potentially towards Belgium and the German border.\n\nThe battle kicked off on April 9 with the British beginning the Battle of Arras, which was meant to draw German attention to the north and distract them from the main French assault. On April 16, the Reserve Army Group (GAR) attacked the Chemin des Dames, and the next day, the Fourth Army, part of the Central Army Group (GAC), launched its assault near Reims to the south-east, known as the Battle of the Hills.\n\nHowever, the offensive encountered significant challenges and was ultimately met with limited success. The German defense was strong, and the offensive faced difficulties in coordination and terrain. The lack of adequate communication and logistical support, as well as counterattacks by the Germans, resulted in a costly and less-than-expected outcome. The Nivelle Offensive ultimately failed to achieve its objectives and contributed to the loss of confidence in the French leadership, leading to the fall of Nivelle and a series of changes in command and military strategy.",

At its peak, it recorded maximum sustained winds of 140 kilometers per hour (85 miles per hour). Unfortunately, the storm's intensity began to wane due to increased wind shear, which disrupted the storm's convection and caused it to veer northwest and west.\n\nUltimately, Hurricane Ingrid made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm on September 16.

            "actual_output": "The Thirty Years' War was a war which lasted from 1618 to 1648. It was fought primarily in Central Europe and was one of the most destructive conflicts in human history. The war resulted in eight million fatalities, not only from military engagements but also from violence, famine, and plague. The majority of the casualties were from the Holy Roman Empire, with the rest being battle deaths from various foreign armies.\n\nThe war had a devastating impact on Europe, particularly in Germany. It is estimated that 20% of the total population of Germany died during the conflict, with losses reaching up to 50% in certain regions. This high death toll was due to a combination of factors, including the deadly clashes between armies, violence, famine, and the spread of diseases like plague.\n\nIn terms of proportional German casualties and destruction, the Thirty Years' War was surpassed only by the period from January to May 1945 during World War II. This devastating conflict served as a cautionary tale and became a key justification for the 1871 creation of the German Empire, although it excluded the German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire.\n\nThe war initially began as a conflict between various Protestant and Catholic states within the fragmented Holy Roman Empire. However, it gradually evolved into a more general conflict involving most of the European great powers. These powers employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the rivalry between France and the Habsburg dynasty for European political dominance.\n\nThe war was preceded by the election of the new Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, who attempted to impose religious uniformity on his domains, forcing Roman Catholicism on its people. The northern Protestant states, angered by the violation of their rights to religious liberty, which had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg, banded together to form the Protestant Union.\n\nFerdinand II was a devout Roman Catholic and significantly less tolerant than his predecessor, Rudolf II, who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague. Ferdinand's policies were considered strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant, causing widespread fear and concern throughout northern and central Europe.\n\nThese events led to the Protestant Bohemians living in the then-relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria to revolt against their nominal ruler, Ferdinand II. The war escalated from there, with various Protestant and Catholic states aligning themselves with different factions and engaging in conflict throughout Central Europe.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War had far-reaching consequences, shaping the political landscape of Europe for centuries to come. It contributed to the decline of the Holy Roman Empire and the rise of modern nation-states. It also marked the beginning of the decline of the Habsburg dynasty, which had previously held significant power in Europe.\n\nIn terms of religion, the war had a profound impact on the religious landscape of Europe. It contributed to the decline of the power of the Catholic Church and the rise of Protestantism, particularly in northern Europe. The war also led to the emergence of religious tolerance as a guiding principle in many countries, as people recognized the need to avoid such devastating conflicts in the future.\n\nOverall, the Thirty Years' War was a pivotal event in European history, with far-reaching consequences that continue to shape our world today.",

The Germans were to be pursued towards Belgium and the German frontier, where the French armies would meet the British advancing from the Arras front.\n\nThe offensive was led by General Robert Nivelle, who had replaced Joseph Joffre as Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in December 1916. Despite initial success, the offensive quickly bogged down and became a costly stalemate. The French suffered heavy casualties and morale plummeted. Nivelle was eventually replaced by General Philippe P\u00e9tain, who implemented a new strategy of defensive tactics and limited offensives.\n\nThe Nivelle Offensive is considered a significant turning point in the First World War, as it marked the end of the era of large-scale offensives and the beginning of a new phase of defensive warfare.

Batts admitted that the officers had violated department policy by not securing Gray inside the van during transport, a practice that was implemented six days prior to Gray's arrest due to concerns about injuries suffered during previous custody. The medical investigation confirmed that Gray's injuries were indeed sustained during the van ride.\n\nThe medical examiner's office ultimately ruled Gray's death a homicide, stating that it was caused by the officers' failure to follow safety procedures, which was an act of omission.

            "input": "\nThe Thirty Years ' War was a war fought primarily in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648 .One of the most destructive conflicts in human history , it resulted in eight million fatalities not only from military engagements but also from violence , famine , and plague .Casualties were overwhelmingly and disproportionately inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire , most of the rest being battle deaths from various foreign armies .The deadly clashes ravaged Europe ; 20 percent of the total population of Germany died during the conflict and there were losses up to 50 percent in a corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest .In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction , it was surpassed only by the period January to May 1945 ; one of its enduring results was 19th-century Pan-Germanism , when it served as an example of the dangers of a divided Germany and became a key justification for the 1871 creation of the German Empire ( although it excluded the German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire ) .Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire , it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the European great powers .These states employed relatively large mercenary armies , and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France\u2013Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence .The war was preceded by the election of the new Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor , Ferdinand II , who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains , forcing Roman Catholicism on its peoples .The northern Protestant states , angered by the violation of their rights to religious liberty , which had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg , banded together to form the Protestant Union .Ferdinand II was a devout Roman Catholic and much less tolerant than his predecessor , Rudolf II , who ruled from the largely Protestant city of Prague .Ferdinand 's policies were considered strongly pro-Catholic and anti-Protestant .These events caused widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe , and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria ( and also with the Holy Roman Empire ) to revolt against their nominal ruler , Ferdinand II .",
            "actual_output": "The Thirty Years' War was a devastating conflict that lasted from 1618 to 1648, primarily fought in Central Europe. It is often considered one of the most destructive wars in human history, with an estimated eight million fatalities from various causes, including military engagements, violence, famine, and plague. The majority of the casualties were concentrated in the Holy Roman Empire, with up to 20% of the population dying during the war. Even more shocking, in some regions, like the corridor between Pomerania and the Black Forest, losses were as high as 50% of the population.\n\nThe origins of the war were religious, as it was initially a struggle between Protestant and Catholic states within the fragmented Holy Roman Empire. The election of Ferdinand II, a strict Roman Catholic, as the new emperor led to tensions, as he sought to impose religious uniformity on his domains, specifically forcing Catholicism on the Protestant populations. This breach of the religious rights granted in the Peace of Augsburg by his predecessor, Rudolf II, in Prague, fueled the Protestant rebellion.\n\nThe war expanded beyond religious differences, as major European powers, including Spain, Sweden, France, and England, became involved. These states employed large mercenary armies, turning it into a complex geopolitical struggle for power and influence. The conflict was marked by constant shifting alliances and shifting frontlines, making it difficult to pin down a single cause.\n\nThe war ultimately weakened the Holy Roman Empire, and its aftermath saw the emergence of the Habsburgs as a dominant force in Central Europe. The Treaty of Westphalia, signed in 1648, marked the end of the war but also partitioned the empire and set the stage for future conflicts, particularly the desire for a unified Germany. Pan-Germanism, a movement advocating for a single, powerful German state, was influenced by the perceived dangers of the divided empire experienced during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nIn summary, the Thirty Years' War was a multi-layered conflict that began as a religious struggle but evolved into a larger European power contest. It led to immense suffering and significant territorial changes, shaping the political landscape of the region for generations to come.",
            "expected_output": "After the so-called Defenestration of Prague deposed the Emperor 's representatives in Prague , the Protestant estates and Catholic Habsburgs started gathering allies for war .The Protestant Bohemians ousted the Habsburgs and elected the Calvinist Frederick V , Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate as the new king of the Kingdom of Bohemia .Frederick took the offer without the support of the Protestant Union .The southern states , mainly Roman Catholic , were angered by this .Led by Bavaria , these states formed the Catholic League to expel Frederick in support of the Emperor .The Empire soon crushed the perceived Protestant rebellion in the Battle of White Mountain , executing leading Bohemian aristocrats shortly after .Protestant rulers across Europe unanimously condemned the Emperor 's action .After the atrocities committed in Bohemia , Saxony finally gave its support to the Protestant Union and decided to fight back .Sweden , at the time a rising military power , soon intervened in 1630 under its king Gustavus Adolphus , transforming what had been simply the Emperor 's attempt to curb the Protestant states into a full-scale war in Europe .",

It was part of a broader Allied strategy to break through the German lines in France and gain a decisive victory. The offensive was designed to be a coordinated operation between the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and two main French army groups, the Reserve Army Group (GAR) and the Central Army Group (GAC).\n\nGeneral Robert Nivelle, who had taken over as Commander-in-Chief of the French Army from Joseph Joffre, had planned the operation in December 1916. The main objective of the Aisne offensive was to capture the heavily fortified Chemin des Dames ridge, which was seen as a crucial strategic point controlling the northern approaches to Paris. By capturing this ridge, the Allies aimed to push the German forces northwards and eventually reach the city of Laon.\n\nThe offensive began with the British offensive at Arras on April 9, followed by the GAR launching an attack on the Chemin des Dames on April 16. The Fourth Army, under the GAC, joined the fight on April 17, engaging in the Battle of the Hills around Reims. The attacks were initially successful, with the French making significant gains, but the terrain and the German defense held up the offensive.\n\nAs the French armies pushed forward, the German counterattacks became more intense, and the offensive faced numerous challenges. The weather, particularly the heavy rain, played a significant role, making the going difficult for both sides. The offensive ultimately proved to be a costly and strategic failure for the Allies, as it did not achieve its primary goal of a quick and decisive victory. It also highlighted the exhaustion and strain on the French army, which had already experienced significant losses in previous battles.\n\nThe Nivelle Offensive marked a turning point in the war, as it demonstrated the difficulties of large-scale offensives and the need for a more coordinated and sustainable approach to the conflict. The failure of the offensive and the subsequent mutiny among French soldiers, known as the Nivelle Mutiny, further weakened the French army and ultimately led to changes in military strategy.",

            "input": "\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India .The conflict began following Pakistan 's Operation Gibraltar , which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule .India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan .the unk war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since world war ii .Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States , and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration .Much of the war was fought by the countries ' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan .",
            "actual_output": "The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, also known as the Indo-Pakistan Border War, was a significant conflict that arose from a series of events and tensions between India and Pakistan. It was triggered by Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which aimed to infiltrate forces into Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir with the objective of fueling an insurgency. India perceived this as a direct challenge to its sovereignty and responded by launching a full-scale military operation on West Pakistan.\n\nThe war saw heavy involvement of both countries' land forces, particularly in the region of Kashmir, where most of the conflict took place. It was the first major war between nuclear-armed nations, which added a heightened sense of urgency and complexity to the situation. The use of armored vehicles and tanks, as you mentioned, was unprecedented, with both sides employing large numbers of tanks in a battle that was one of the largest since World War II.\n\nThe war lasted for approximately four months, during which both sides suffered significant casualties. The United Nations (UN) intervened to mediate a ceasefire, with the Soviet Union and the United States playing key diplomatic roles. This led to the Tashkent Declaration, which was signed on November 21, 1965, which called for the restoration of the pre-war borders and the withdrawal of both countries' forces from each other's territory.\n\nThe war had far-reaching consequences, including a strengthening of India's position in South Asia, increased international isolation for Pakistan, and a renewed focus on\u5370\u5df4 relations. It also highlighted the importance of border security and the potential for conflict escalation among nuclear-armed nations. The conflict left a lasting impact on both countries and contributed to the ongoing rivalry between them.",
            "expected_output": "This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of India in 1947 , a number that was overshadowed only during the 2001\u20132002 military standoff between India and Pakistan .Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units , with substantial backing from air forces , and naval operations .Many details of this war , like those of other Indo-Pakistani Wars , remain unclear .India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared .although the two countries fought to a standoff , the conflict is seen as a strategic and political defeat for pakistan , as it had neither succeeded in fomenting insurrection in kashmir nor had it been able to gain meaningful support at an international level .",

            "actual_output": " Hurricane Ingrid, which struck Mexico in 2013, was a significant event in the Atlantic hurricane season, marking the first time in 55 years that two tropical cyclones, specifically named storms, hit the country within a 24-hour period. It occurred during a period of heightened activity that year.\n\nIngrid formed on September 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, emerging from a broader disturbance that also spawned Hurricane Manuel in the eastern Pacific. Initially, the storm moved westward toward Veracruz, a coastal city in Mexico, but a change in direction was observed. Instead of making landfall, Ingrid turned northeastward, avoiding the coast and heading towards the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\nOn September 14, favorable conditions allowed Ingrid to strengthen into a hurricane, reaching winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). However, increased wind shear, which is the change in direction and speed of the winds that opposes the rotation of a storm, weakened the storm's convection, or the towering thunderstorms that are essential for its development. This led to a more northeasterly and westerly track.\n\nOn September 16, Ingrid made landfall near the city of La Pesca, located in northeastern Mexico, as a strong tropical storm. Despite the weakening, the storm caused significant damage and heavy rainfall, with impacts felt in the region. The storm dissipated the next day, marking the conclusion of its impact on the country.\n\nOverall, Hurricane Ingrid's rapid and unexpected movement, along with its strength when it made landfall, was a stark reminder of the potential dangers that tropical cyclones can bring to Mexico, particularly in the hurricane season. The event served as a Wake-up call for preparedness and emergency management in the area.",
