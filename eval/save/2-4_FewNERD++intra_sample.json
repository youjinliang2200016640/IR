Remember that I am an AI developed by Infinigence-AI and I don't have access to external databases, so the information I provide is based on the knowledge I have been trained on up to my last knowledge cutoff in 2023.\n\nHere is an example of text with entities and the types I would categorize them into:\n\n```\nProtozoans such as Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause diarrhea.\n\nType: Biological entity (Biological: Organism)\n```\n\nProtozoans are organisms that belong to the phylum Protozoa. They are multicellular organisms that usually do not differentiate into specialized cells. Protozoans can cause a variety of diseases and are small, simple organisms.\n\n\"Giardia lamblia\" is a species of protozoan that can cause a variety of diseases, in particular, giardiasis, which can cause abdominal pain, weight loss, and infertility in humans.\n\n\"Cryptosporidium\" is another genus of protozoan that can also cause giardiasis-like conditions, often in animals such as dogs and cats, but can also infect humans.\n\n\"Cyclospora cayetanensis\" is another protozoan species that can cause cyclosporiasis, a disease characterized by diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and weight loss. Like Giardia and Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora is a parasitic infectious agent that can be passed from an infected host to a new host through the fecal-oral route.\n\nAll of these protozoans are examples of biological entities that can cause various forms of diarrhea.\n\nThe text also mentions \"diarrhea,\" which is not an entity in the sense of having a specific biological or taxonomic identity, but rather a symptom or clinical sign. Diarrhea is a common symptom associated with many different causes, including parasites, bacteria, viruses, and digestive disorders. It can be caused by a variety of protozoans, viruses, and other organisms.",
