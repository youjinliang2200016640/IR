It also mentions the allegiance of this country to include certain Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland, and that its shares are not available to the general public like those of a public limited company (plc). The word \"allegiance\" in the context is a bit broad, as it can refer to various forms of legal obligation to the state, such as the duty of citizenship.\n\nAs an AI, I don't have a specific identity or \"nationhood,\" but I am designed to represent and understand human languages across the world.
