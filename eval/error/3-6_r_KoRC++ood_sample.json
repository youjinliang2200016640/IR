At the least, United plays hard for the former English superstar, whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans. On Saturday, for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season, United\u2019s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point. Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute, ending a night of frustration for goal-averse United in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City. Opportunities were aplenty for United (1-1-1), but it took Durkin\u2019s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire\u2019s goal early in the second half. \u201cI wanted to see a reaction [to Orlando\u2019s goal], which I did, so 90 percent of the game I thought was good. The 10 percent, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWe need to make sure when we go into them [low] periods, we\u2019re harder to beat or harder to score against.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn\u2019t take three points.\u201d At the top of the box, Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo, then ripped a 16-yard, left-footed shot with terrific technique and execution. The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin\u2019s third career MLS goal. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve hit that [with the left foot] in training before,\u201d the right-footed Durkin said, smiling. United goalkeeper Tyler Miller said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know he had such a good left foot. It was amazing.\u201d Aside from McGuire\u2019s goal, United was much tighter and tidier defensively than it was against Columbus last weekend. In the attack, however, it remained inefficient with scoring opportunities, and Rooney said, \u201cWe could have easily been two or three up in the first half.\u201d Orlando (1-0-2) played its first away match in league play after defeating the New York Red Bulls, 1-0, and drawing with FC Cincinnati, 0-0. At the moment, though, the Lions\u2019 priority is the Concacaf Champions League. The visit to Washington fell between legs of a round-of-16 series with Mexican power Tigres. A 0-0 draw in Monterrey, Mexico, on Tuesday positioned them well for the return match in Florida on Wednesday. With that in mind, Orlando Coach Oscar Pareja made six lineup changes Saturday. Through three matches this year, the Lions had not conceded a goal. United was coming off a scoreless effort at Columbus, and for the first time, attacker Ted Ku-DiPietro, the hero on opening night, was in the lineup, replacing Nigel Robertha (illness). Center back Derrick Williams and right back Ruan, a former Orlando player, also made their first starts. United set the terms but continued to labor in the box. In the 27th minute, Christian Benteke was alone 12 yards out after settling Durkin\u2019s cross, but with most of the net at his pleasure, he shot too close to Gallese, who made a reaction save. Seven minutes later, Gallese thwarted Ku-DiPietro\u2019s 12-yard one-timer.\n\nQuestion: What specific tournament or league did [human] participate in as a competitor?",

The perfect addition to a garden bed or an easy way to ruin your landscaping? No matter your opinion, there\u2019s no denying that these little folks are conversation starters. The story of how these sometimes whimsical, sometimes comical, sometimes vulgar statues became fixtures in yards and gardens is as colorful and complex as the creatures themselves. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with gnomes,\u201d says Twigs Way, garden historian and author of \u201cGarden Gnomes: A History.\u201d \u201cThey come from lots of different kinds of sources.\u201d There are plenty of little characters in mythologies from around the world \u2014 including the Egyptian god Bes, and brownies, house spirits in British and Scottish folklore \u2014 and small stone figures started appearing in Italian gardens during the Renaissance. However, according to Way, what have become known as garden gnomes in the United States and England can be traced to dwarf statues that originated in Germany\u2019s Black Forest region around the early 19th century. They were initially carved out of wood; by the mid-19th century, they were cast in terra cotta and porcelain. They weren\u2019t a garden fixture, though; they were hand-painted, usually about three feet tall and expensive, so they were intended to be displayed inside as pieces of art. Although those figures were often depicted in what has become their trademark red conical hats, blue shirts and boots, they didn\u2019t strike lazy or lackadaisical poses. They were gardeners, carpenters, fishermen, even hunters. \u201cTo see pictures of gnomes with shotguns kind of took me aback,\u201d says Way, who uncovered such images in old catalogues. Sir Charles Isham gets credit for bringing the dwarves into Britain and out into the garden, importing a number of them from Germany in the 1840s to decorate his massive rockery garden at Lamport Hall, his estate in Northamptonshire. It wasn\u2019t the most auspicious introduction. \u201cHe was extremely eccentric,\u201d Way says. \u201cThe fact that the first person that starts collecting them in England is a pro-socialist vegetarian teetotaler who believes dwarfs and little folk are real is not a great way to establish their legitimacy.\u201d The next ambassador of the small statues was another oddball: Sir Frank Crisp, whose roughly 62-acre estate in Henley-on-Thames, Friar Park, was dotted with German garden gnomes and open to the public in the early 20th century. (George Harrison of the Beatles bought the property in 1970 and claimed to unearth a few of the original gnomes, which he posed with on the cover of his album \u201cAll Things Must Pass.\u201d) Wealthy landowners began adopting the gnomes \u2014 as they were commonly called by then \u2014 as sophisticated garden accessories, thanks to Isham and Crisp. Photos of them even appeared in Britain\u2019s arbiter of high-end style, Country Life magazine. In 1912, gnomes were featured at the Royal International Horticultural Exhibition, a forerunner of the Chelsea Flower Show, which began the following year and didn\u2019t allow gnomes to be featured, because trendsetters of the time determined they weren\u2019t tasteful enough. Their 15 minutes of fame with the posh crowd was almost over.\n\nQuestion: What continent is [Rechtsstaat] situated in?",
