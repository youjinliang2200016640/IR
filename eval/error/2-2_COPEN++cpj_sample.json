Anabolic steroids do significantly contribute to increased muscular mass in bodybuilders. These drugs stimulate muscle growth by mimicking the effects of natural testosterone, allowing individuals to build muscle more rapidly and to a greater extent than what would be achievable through natural training alone.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all bodybuilders rely solely on steroids. Many follow intense workout regimens, proper nutrition, and supplementation to enhance their muscle development. Steroids are a performance-enhancing drug, and their use is illegal in many sports and competitions. Additionally, the long-term health risks associated with steroid use, such as liver damage, cardiovascular problems, and hormonal imbalances, should be considered.\n\nTherefore, while anabolic steroids play a significant role in the increased muscle mass of some bodybuilders, it's not accurate to generalize that all bodybuilders rely on them to achieve superhuman levels of muscularity.

As a result, we can say that \"A member of parliament is Order\" could be interpreted as a member of parliament should adhere to and promote order within the parliamentary proceedings.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statement \"A member of parliament is Order\" can be considered true in the sense that a member of parliament should maintain order and adhere to the rules of the chamber. However, it should be noted that this statement is not universally true, as there may be instances where individual members of parliament do not comply with these expectations.",
