If you're asking about a specific Velasco-class cruiser that currently exists, you'll need more information, such as its registry number or build details, to determine its manufacturer. However, if the question is hypothetical and you're asking about the manufacturers of a Velasco-class cruiser that doesn't exist, you would need to research that to find the answer, which would require additional data and research.",
