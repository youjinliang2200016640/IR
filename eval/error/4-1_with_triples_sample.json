While being transported in a police van, Gray fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center. Gray died on April 19, 2015; his death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord. On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were suspended with pay. The circumstances of the injuries were initially unclear; eyewitness accounts suggested that the officers involved used unnecessary force against Gray during the arrest \u2013 a claim denied by all officers involved. Commissioner Anthony W. Batts reported that, contrary to department policy, the officers did not secure him inside the van while driving to the police station; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Gray\u2019s arrest, following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city, and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years. The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport. The medical examiner\u2019s office concluded that Gray\u2019s death could not be ruled an accident, and was instead a homicide, because officers failed to follow safety procedures \u201cthrough acts of omission.\u201d Marilyn Mosby, the Baltimore state\u2019s attorney, announced on April 22 that her office had filed charges against six police officers involved in Gray\u2019s death. The charges included second-degree murder, three counts of manslaughter, and second-degree reckless endangerment. On April 27, a grand jury indicted the officers. The officers were accused of failing to provide Gray with medical attention, and of using excessive force while he was in custody, which led to his death. A major protest turned violent, resulting in injuries to 15 police officers and 34 arrests. The protest was in response to Gray\u2019s hospitalization, and the death of the six police officers. The protest resulted in local businesses being looted and burned. The Maryland National Guard was deployed to Baltimore to help maintain order. The state of emergency declaration was announced by Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, on April 25. The declaration established a curfew, and the establishment of a state of emergency declaration was the culminating event in a series of protests and civil disorder in Baltimore. Freddie Gray\u2019s funeral was held in Baltimore on April 30. The medical examiner\u2019s report ruled Gray\u2019s death a homicide, and the case was seen as a turning point in the debate over police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.",

The Nivelle Offensive was launched in an attempt to take the strategic high ground at Chemin des Dames and to drive through to the German border.The French Fourth and Reserve Armies were tasked with the offensive. Philippe P\u00e9tain, Commander-in-Chief of the French armies, was responsible for the defense and consolidation of the captured territory.Despite the defeat suffered by the French at the hands of the Germians, the Nivelle Offensive continued to progress in the north, allowing the Allies to maintain their momentum and continued to push the Germans back along the rest of the front line. However, the Battle of the Hills marked the end of the French offensive and marked a turning point in the war, as the Germians were able to regain the initiative and the momentum shifted back to the Germans. The French suffered heavy casualties in the process of trying to consolidate their gains, which significantly depleted their army and put an end to their offensive capability for the rest of the war.",

Ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. It initially moved westward toward Veracruz but turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed Ingrid to attain hurricane status on September 14, with peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). However, increased wind shear weakened the convection and turned the storm more to the northwest and west. Ingrid made landfall as a strong tropical storm on September 16, just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico, and dissipated the next day.\n\nIngrid affected two-thirds of Mexico, killing 192 people and causing at least 32 deaths in Mexico. The hurricane also killed people in Mexico, causing damage worth millions of dollars. Ingrid caused damage worth millions of dollars, killing 32 people in Mexico. Rainfall from the storm peaked at Tuxpan, with rainfall reaching its peak. The hurricane also affected every dam in Mexico, filling them with water. ",
