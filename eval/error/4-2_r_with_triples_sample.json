United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney, still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season. At the least, United plays hard for the former English superstar, whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans. On Saturday, for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season, United's resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point. Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute, ending a night of frustration for goal-averse United in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City. Opportunities were aplenty for United (1-1-1), but it took Durkin's strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire's goal early in the second half. \u201cI wanted to see a reaction [to Orlando's goal], which I did, so 90 percent of the game I thought was good. The 10 percent, it wasn't,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWe need to make sure when we go into them [low] periods, we're harder to beat or harder to score against.\u201d He added, \u201cThere's a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn't take three points.\u201d At the top of the box, Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo, then ripped a 16-yard, left-footed shot with terrific technique and execution. The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin's third career MLS goal. Tyler Miller said, \u201cI didn't know he had such a good left foot.\u201d D.C.

It's a mutual parting, although it's not how I envisioned my time with Green Bay coming to an end.

I've always cherished the relationships I've built here, but my love for the game and the competitive fire within me compel me to explore new opportunities.\"\n\nHe continued, \"The Packers have a storied history, and I've been fortunate to be a part of it. But as the NFL's free agent market opened, I saw this as an opportunity to find a fresh start, where I could bring my skills and experience to a new team. The Jets have shown interest and a genuine desire to have me as their quarterback, and I believe we can accomplish great things together.\"\n\nDespite the delay in the trade, Rodgers remains hopeful that a resolution can be reached soon. \"I've been drafted by the Packers, and now I'm on the move, ready to be drafted by the Jets. I'm excited about the potential of joining the Jets organization, being a leader on and off the field, and contributing to their success.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Aaron Rodgers expressed his gratitude to Green Bay and the Packers for the opportunities they've given him, while also looking forward to the next chapter of his career in New York. \"I love this game, and I'm confident that the love I have for the game and the commitment I bring will be reciprocated in my new home.

C . United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney , still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season .At the least , United plays hard for the former English superstar , whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans .On Saturday , for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season , United \u2019 s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point .Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute , ending a night of frustration for goal - averse United in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City .Opportunities were aplenty for United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ), but it took Durkin \u2019 s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire \u2019 s goal early in the second half .\u201c I wanted to see a reaction [ to Orlando \u2019 s goal ], which I did , so 90 percent of the game I thought was good .The 10 percent , it wasn \u2019 t ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We need to make sure when we go into them [ low ] periods , we \u2019 re harder to beat or harder to score against .\u201d He added , \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn \u2019 t take three points .\u201d At the top of the box , Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo , then ripped a 16 - yard , left - footed shot with terrific technique and execution .The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin \u2019 s third career MLS goal .",
            "actual_output": "\n\n[PT] #\n\n[ID] #\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#### \n\n[PT] United still plays without injured striker Taxi Fountas , who is out indefinitely with a thigh issue .Fountas \u2019 s absence was felt in the first half , when United peppered Gallese with shots , but only managed three on target .Winger Miguel Berry and midfielder Pedro Santos had good looks at goal , but Gallese was equal to the task .In the 45th minute , after a wild scramble in the area , Gallese denied forward Christian Benteke , who had a rebound opportunity .At the other end , United goalkeeper Tyler Miller was rarely tested .Forward Facundo Torres fired a shot from outside the area that Miller handled without incident .A minute later , Torres again tried his luck from distance , but his shot went wide .United began the second half with a near - miss from Santos , whose left - footed shot whizzed over the bar .Santos and Benteke had other chances to score , but United \u2019 s inability to convert in the opening half came back to haunt it .McGuire opened his MLS account with a 49th - minute goal , capitalizing on a clever pass from Torres .Ara\u00fajo gave the ball away in the middle of the field and Torres took advantage , threading a pass to McGuire , who beat Miller from close range .The goal seemed to rattle United , which looked disjointed and lacking in ideas .Without Fountas , United has had to improvise in attack .But even with the Greek forward out , United should have had enough to win at home .\u201c We could have easily been two or three up in the first half , but you have to take your chances ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We didn \u2019 t , so we made it hard on ourselves .\u201d United \u2019 s best chance to take the lead before Durkin \u2019 s goal was a 35 - yard free kick from Rooney that Gallese pushed over the bar .Orlando City ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) , which has yet to win in three MLS matches , remained without striker Ercan Kara , who is recovering from a calf injury .Kara missed Orlando \u2019 s 1 - 1 draw with New York Red Bulls last Sunday and didn \u2019 t travel to Washington .In Kara \u2019 s absence , Orlando Coach Oscar Pareja positioned his team to sit deep , trying to frustrate United and catch it on the counter - attack .\u201c When you have a lot of the ball , you have to make sure you attack in the right way ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c I thought we did that .But you have to take your chances .\u201d The match could have turned out differently had Durkin not scored .Durkin did not start in United \u2019 s first two games , but the 22 - year - old midfielder made his second straight start Saturday and justified Rooney \u2019 s decision to include him in the first XI .\u201c I \u2019 ve hit that [ with the left foot ] in training before ,\u201d Durkin said .\u201c I can \u2019 t say I \u2019 ve hit that [ with the left foot ] in training before .\u201d The goal was Durkin \u2019 s first since last May , when he scored against Orlando City .#\n\n[ID] #\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#### \n\n[PT] Chris Durkin \u2019 s left foot is a thing of beauty .The D . C . United midfielder used it to great effect Saturday night , scoring a spectacular 80th - minute goal in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City at Audi Field .Durkin \u2019 s strike \u2014 a left - footed shot fired from 16 yards \u2014 capped a frustrating night for United , which dominated Orlando but could not take the lead .Durkin \u2019 s goal was his third in three MLS seasons .D . C . United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) remains unbeaten at Audi Field this season .United plays its next two matches on the road \u2014 against FC Cincinnati on March 18 and at the New York Red Bulls on March 25 .#\n\n[ID] #\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#### \n\n[PT] D .

ChatGPT and other \"large-language models\" - artificially intelligent systems trained on vast troves of text - can turn into liars or racists or terrorist accomplices that explain how to build dirty bombs. The question is: When that happens, who's responsible? Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act says that services - from Facebook and Google to movie-review aggregators and mommy blogs with comment sections - shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties. It's fairly easy in these cases to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. Not so with chatbots and AI assistants. Few have grappled with whether Section 230 provides protections to them. Consider ChatGPT. Type in a question, and it provides an answer.",
