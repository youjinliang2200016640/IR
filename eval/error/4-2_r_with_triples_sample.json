At the least, United plays hard for the former English superstar, whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans. On Saturday, for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season, United's resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point. Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute, ending a night of frustration for goal-averse United in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City. Opportunities were aplenty for United (1-1-1), but it took Durkin's strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire's goal early in the second half. \u201cI wanted to see a reaction [to Orlando's goal], which I did, so 90 percent of the game I thought was good.

S . Soccer Federation said Berhalter would remain a candidate to return as coach .His contract expired Dec . 31 .\u201c Given the investigators \u2019 conclusion that there is no legal impediment to employing him , Gregg Berhalter remains a candidate to serve as head coach ,\u201d the USSF said in a statement .The governing body said it will not hire a coach until it appoints a new sporting director , a position that oversees all national teams .",

ChatGPT and other `large-language models` - artificially intelligent systems trained on vast troves of text - can turn into liars or racists or terrorist accomplices that explain how to build dirty bombs. The question is: When that happens, who's responsible? Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act says that services - from Facebook and Google to movie-review aggregators and mommy blogs with comment sections - shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties. It's fairly easy in these cases to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. Not so with chatbots and AI assistants. Few have grappled with whether Section 230 provides protections to them. Consider ChatGPT. Type in a question, and it provides an answer.",
