Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties.

On the night of 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (part of the 7th Motor Brigade), with thirteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns and the 239th Battery, 76th Anti-Tank Regiment RA, with six more 6-pounders, was <Event> ordered </Event> to occupy a desert feature known as Snipe, a small depression in the landscape south-west of Kidney Ridge that was suitable for an outpost. Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n",
