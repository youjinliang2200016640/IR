Reducing muscle breakdown: AAS can inhibit the breakdown of muscle tissue, allowing for greater muscle retention and growth.\n3. Enhancing muscle pump: AAS can increase blood flow to the muscles, leading to a greater influx of nutrients and oxygen, which can contribute to increased muscle growth.\n\nStudies have consistently shown that AAS use is prevalent in professional bodybuilding circles. For example, a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that 70% of professional bodybuilders admitted to using AAS at some point in their careers. Another study published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism found that 45% of competitive bodybuilders reported using AAS in the past year.\n\nIt's important to note that while AAS can significantly enhance muscle mass, they can also have serious health risks, including cardiovascular problems, liver damage, and testicular atrophy. Additionally, many professional bodybuilders have been disqualified from competitions or banned from the sport due to AAS use.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that some bodybuilders may achieve remarkable muscle mass through natural means, such as intense training, proper nutrition, and dedication. However, in many cases, AAS use is a significant factor contributing to their exceptional physiques.", "expected_output": "true", "context": null, "retrieval_context": null, "time": 5416831400}, {"id": "id1295", "AnswerModel": "llama-3-8b-instruct", "input": "\nIs the statement 'A member of parliament is Order' true or false?", "actual_output": "A clever question!\n\nThe answer is: FALSE.\n\nA Member of Parliament (MP) is a person who is elected to represent a constituency in the Parliament, whereas \"Order\" is a command or a regulation that is meant to maintain discipline or control.
