and transplanted in the entity0 United States entity0 could save many lives \u2014 if the entity1 Biden entity1 administration succeeds in breaking up the monopoly of the network that currently runs it . \n Some 106 , 000 entity2 Americans entity2 are on an organ waiting list , and 22 die each day in want of organs such as kidneys , livers and hearts , according to the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine . \n Many of these deaths are preventable . \n A 2018 entity3 Post entity3 analysis found that tens of thousands of potentially usable organs go uncollected every year . \n If this resource were better managed , the organ waitlist could be substantially cut or eliminated . \n More people would live . \n A big part of the problem is that monopolies run the organ procurement system . \n Across the country , 56 \u201c organ procurement organizations \u201d have exclusive control over collecting organs in their respective regions . \n On the national level , the entity4 United Network for Organ Sharing entity4 ( entity5 UNOS entity5 ), a quasi - governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n", "actual_output": "entity0, located in, entity0 entity0, country,

screaming and begging not to go ? \n Or if he was excited to leave without looking back ? \n Would a day come when he regretted the life and the people he \u2019 d left behind ? \n Would Luke be able to love him and Padm\u00e9 ? \n Would that be enough to replace Beru and Owen in his heart ? \n Should it be enough ? \n He swiped one hand over his face and turned back to the ship . \n Light was

\u201c I know you know I do .\u201d Owen \u2019 s answering smile was as shaky as hers . \n He leaned his cheek on the top of her head . \n \u201c It \u2019 s nearly dawn . \n I wonder when they

.\u201d \u201c You know he refuses to get up before the suns do .\u201d This time her smile was real . \n But it faded quickly . \n Would this be the last morning she roused her boy ? \n The last time she helped him dress ? \n Anakin and Padm\u00e9 had never dressed a child , would they know he wanted to do everything himself ? \n But that he needed help , that he never got all the buttons quite right so most of his little clothes were tunics instead of shirts ? \n That sometimes socks went on backwards and had to be twisted around ? \n That leg wraps went over pants and shoes to protect him

We have a diverse body of players , staff and support teams , so the challenges and areas of concern will vary . \n As the governing body , our focus is making sure that players feel they can come forward and share their concerns , which plays a critical role in being able to address the issues that may be at hand ,\u201d entity1 WTA entity1 Chairman and CEO entity7 Steve Simon entity7 said in an email to entity6 The Associated Press entity6 . \n Might be hard to gauge the success of such an initiative so soon , but entity8 Simon entity8 found at least one positive measure . \n \u201c We are seeing more athletes coming forward ,\u201d he said , \u201c which is a great initial result .\u201d Adding what entity8 Simon entity8 called \u201c the expertise of a dedicated safeguarding position \u201d is the biggest public - facing step taken by the Florida - based WTA in this area since the issue of protecting players drew increased attention last year : A French player once ranked as high as No . \n 39 accused her former coach of rape ; another player sued the U .

entity0 United States entity0 could save many lives \u2014 if the entity1 Biden entity1 administration succeeds in breaking up the monopoly of the network that currently runs it . \n Some 106 , 000 entity2 Americans entity2 are on an organ waiting list , and 22 die each day in want of organs such as kidneys , livers and hearts , according to the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine . \n Many of these deaths are preventable . \n A 2018 entity3 Post entity3 analysis found that tens of thousands of potentially usable organs go uncollected every year . \n If this resource were better managed , the organ waitlist could be substantially cut or eliminated . \n More people would live . \n A big part of the problem is that monopolies run the organ procurement system . \n Across the country , 56 \u201c organ procurement organizations \u201d have exclusive control over collecting organs in their respective regions . \n On the national level , the entity4 United Network for Organ Sharing entity4 ( entity5 UNOS entity5 ), a quasi - governmental agency , is supposed to oversee these regional organ procurers and run the logistical operation that matches organs with doctors , hospitals , labs and , ultimately , patients . \n Yet entity5 UNOS entity5 , too , is effectively a monopoly , having held the contract for running the system since it was created nearly 40 years ago . \n With no competition , performance suffers . \n Independent reviews have found big problems , particularly in the technology entity5 UNOS entity5 uses to get organs from organ procurement organizations to the right patients at the right transplant centers , which critics complain still relies excessively on manual data entry . \n The system is prone to crashing , as it did for 40 minutes in February . \n This sort of failure could render unhealthy a freshly procured organ if it meant a delay in transporting it . \n Nationally , more than one - fifth of recovered kidneys are not transplanted into needy people , a rate far worse than in peer entity6 European entity6 countries . \n There have been preventable \u2014 and deadly \u2014 snafus . \n A entity7 Senate Finance Committee entity7 investigation attributed 70 deaths and 249 illnesses to mistakes in organ screening before transplantation . \n A well - meaning reform meant to get organs transplanted into the sickest patients first appears to have led to a rise in the number of wasted livers , according to a new entity3 Post entity3 analysis . \n entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s contract with the federal government is up for renewal this year , and entity1 Biden entity1 administration officials proposed Wednesday some major reforms . \n One reason entity5 UNOS entity5 has typically encountered little competition for the contract to run the organ transplant system is that there are few entities that can operate a logistics network and perform all of entity5 UNOS entity5 \u2019 s other tasks . \n So , federal officials want to break UNOS \u2019 s functions into separate contracts , attracting companies to bid for the opportunity to operate specific parts of the system . \n This could be particularly helpful if it induced companies that specialize in complex logistics to seek the contract to improve the organ transplant system \u2019 s IT operations ; if organ logistics were operated as efficiently as FedEx package delivery , fewer may be lost . \n Biden administration officials say they have the legal authority they need to proceed . \n But Congress should provide any funds that might be required , particularly to make the new contracts more attractive to outside companies . \n Lawmakers should also review the statutes governing the organ transplant system , ensuring that the administrations have all necessary powers . \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n", "actual_output": "Here are the relations extracted from the text in the predefined
