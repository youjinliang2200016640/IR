However, a previous relationship with his now-wife, Rosalind, had caused concern. According to the investigation, Berhalter had kicked Rosalind while they were dating while they were students at the University of North Carolina.\n\nIn 2022, Berhalter was involved in another controversy after allegations of domestic abuse were made against him. The allegations, which were made by a former girlfriend, claimed that Berhalter had abused her while they were dating. However, the investigation found no evidence to support these claims, and it was confirmed that Berhalter had not committed any additional acts of violence against his now-wife since 1992.\n\nAdditionally, complaints were made about the treatment of Gio Reyna, a player on the U.S. team at the 2022 World Cup, by coach Berhalter. Reyna's parents claimed that Berhalter had not given their son enough playing time, which they thought was unfair. However, the investigation found that this was due to a lack of fitness and not a deliberate attempt by Berhalter to discriminate against Reyna.\n\nIn conclusion, the investigation by Alston & Bird found no facts to show that the U.S. Soccer Federation knew of the 1992 incident when it hired Berhalter, and no evidence to support claims that similar incidents had occurred at any point in the last 31 years. As a result, Berhalter will remain a candidate to return as coach, provided that a new sporting director is appointed first.

The investigation, which began after Rosalind, Berhalter's now-wife, claimed he kicked her during their time at the University of North Carolina, uncovered no facts to suggest that the soccer federation (USSF) was aware of the 1992 incident when hiring him. This revelation contradicts earlier claims by the firm, which had initially stated that similar incidents had occurred in the last 31 years.\n\nDespite the absence of any proof linking the hiring to the past incident, the USSF maintained that Berhalter's employment is not hindered. In a statement, they announced that Berhalter remains a candidate for the head coach position, as long as no new sporting director is appointed. This move has sparked controversy, with some arguing that the decision to keep Berhalter in the running raises concerns about the organization's handling of past allegations.\n\nIn the meantime, the next coach is preparing the U.S. team for the 2026 World Cup, a task that will take place in their home country. The upcoming activity signals a fresh start for the team after they lost to the Netherlands in the round of 16 during the previous World Cup, further complicating the situation.\n\nRosalind, who initially complained about Berhalter's behavior, later told Alston & Bird that she was not injured and did not file a formal complaint with the university. Her account, however, continues to support the claim that Berhalter posed a risk to others.\n\nThe Alston & Bird report, which initially claimed that similar incidents had occurred, now stands as a nuanced view of the matter. It seems that the investigation did not find any evidence to substantiate the earlier claims, leaving the public and the sport's governing body to ponder the true nature of the situation.\n\nIn the aftermath of this drama, the U.S. soccer community is left grappling with the challenge of rebuilding trust and ensuring that such incidents do not happen again. The upcoming hires and the coaching selection process will undoubtedly be closely scrutinized for any signs that the USSF has learned from the past and is committed to a safer and more accountable environment.", "expected_output": "Earnie Stewart left the job last month .Anthony Hudson , a World Cup assistant , is the interim coach .The next coach will begin preparing the U .

Although the report detailed that no factual evidence was found to connect the 1992 Incident to his present behavior or workplace conduct, Alston & Bird revealed in their findings that similar incidents may have occurred without concrete proof. This revelation fueled concerns and sparked a public debate about the risk Berhalter poses to others.\n\nRosalind's complaint, which she initially leveled against Berhalter, stated that he kicked her while they were dating, an act that left her injured at the University of North Carolina. While she later disclosed the incident to Alston & Bird, she clarified that she was not seriously injured and never pursued legal action against him.\n\nAmidst the controversy, the next coach, preparing for the U.S. team's participation in the 2026 World Cup, was tasked with guiding the young squad, aware of the lingering concerns surrounding Berhalter's past. Despite the loss to the Netherlands in the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup, investigators remained firm in their conclusion, stating that they uncovered no new facts implicating USSF in the 1992 Incident.\n\nAlston & Bird's report, in supporting the claim that Berhalter presents no current risk to others, drew a line under the past, emphasizing that he had not committed any violent acts since 1992 and had adhered to disclosure rules during his hiring process. USSF's decision to keep him in the running for the head coach position indicates their belief that the past transgressions do not negate his coaching abilities and the progress he has made with the team.\n\nAs the search for a new sporting director progresses, the U.S. Soccer Federation is weighing the implications of Berhalter's history and the potential impact it could have on the team's future, all while ensuring a fair and transparent hiring process that upholds the organization's standards.

United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney , still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season .At the least , United plays hard for the former English superstar , whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans .On Saturday , for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season , United \u2019 s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point .Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute , ending a night of frustration for goal - averse United in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City .Opportunities were aplenty for United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ), but it took Durkin \u2019 s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire \u2019 s goal early in the second half .\u201c I wanted to see a reaction [ to Orlando \u2019 s goal ], which I did , so 90 percent of the game I thought was good .The 10 percent , it wasn \u2019 t ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We need to make sure when we go into them [ low ] periods , we \u2019 re harder to beat or harder to score against .\u201d He added , \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn \u2019 t take three points .\u201d At the top of the box , Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo , then ripped a 16 - yard , left - footed shot with terrific technique and execution .The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin \u2019 s third career MLS goal .", "actual_output": "\n\n[PT] #\n\n[ID] #\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#### \n\n[PT] United still plays without injured striker Taxi Fountas , who is out indefinitely with a thigh issue .Fountas \u2019 s absence was felt in the first half , when United peppered Gallese with shots , but only managed three on target .Winger Miguel Berry and midfielder Pedro Santos had good looks at goal , but Gallese was equal to the task .In the 45th minute , after a wild scramble in the area , Gallese denied forward Christian Benteke , who had a rebound opportunity .At the other end , United goalkeeper Tyler Miller was rarely tested .Forward Facundo Torres fired a shot from outside the area that Miller handled without incident .A minute later , Torres again tried his luck from distance , but his shot went wide .United began the second half with a near - miss from Santos , whose left - footed shot whizzed over the bar .Santos and Benteke had other chances to score , but United \u2019 s inability to convert in the opening half came back to haunt it .McGuire opened his MLS account with a 49th - minute goal , capitalizing on a clever pass from Torres .Ara\u00fajo gave the ball away in the middle of the field and Torres took advantage , threading a pass to McGuire , who beat Miller from close range .The goal seemed to rattle United , which looked disjointed and lacking in ideas .Without Fountas , United has had to improvise in attack .But even with the Greek forward out , United should have had enough to win at home .\u201c We could have easily been two or three up in the first half , but you have to take your chances ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We didn \u2019 t , so we made it hard on ourselves .\u201d United \u2019 s best chance to take the lead before Durkin \u2019 s goal was a 35 - yard free kick from Rooney that Gallese pushed over the bar .Orlando City ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) , which has yet to win in three MLS matches , remained without striker Ercan Kara , who is recovering from a calf injury .Kara missed Orlando \u2019 s 1 - 1 draw with New York Red Bulls last Sunday and didn \u2019 t travel to Washington .In Kara \u2019 s absence , Orlando Coach Oscar Pareja positioned his team to sit deep , trying to frustrate United and catch it on the counter - attack .\u201c When you have a lot of the ball , you have to make sure you attack in the right way ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c I thought we did that .But you have to take your chances .\u201d The match could have turned out differently had Durkin not scored .Durkin did not start in United \u2019 s first two games , but the 22 - year - old midfielder made his second straight start Saturday and justified Rooney \u2019 s decision to include him in the first XI .\u201c I \u2019 ve hit that [ with the left foot ] in training before ,\u201d Durkin said .\u201c I can \u2019 t say I \u2019 ve hit that [ with the left foot ] in training before .\u201d The goal was Durkin \u2019 s first since last May , when he scored against Orlando City .#\n\n[ID] #\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#### \n\n[PT] Chris Durkin \u2019 s left foot is a thing of beauty .The D .

He acknowledged, \"I've hit that [with the left foot] in training before,\" referring to the powerful left-footed shot that ultimately levelled the score. Durkin's goal, a stunning 16-yard shot, not only tied the match but also served as a testament to his hard work and skill.\n\nDespite the frustrating draw, Rooney remained positive, emphasizing the team's resilience and the learning opportunities from the match. \"We needed to bounce back from that low period and we did,\" he said. \"It's a good point for us, but we need to make sure we're more clinical in front of goal next time.\"\n\nWith the match ending in a 1-1 draw, both teams left Audi Field with a sense of unfinished business. D.C. United, under Rooney's guidance, is gradually finding its footing in the early stages of the MLS season, while Orlando City will aim to maintain their attacking prowess and capitalize on their momentum in future encounters.\n\nAs the season unfolds, fans and analysts alike will be watching closely to see how D.C.

United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney, still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season. At the least, United plays hard for the former English superstar, whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans. On Saturday, for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season, United's resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point. Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute, ending a night of frustration for goal-averse United in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City. Opportunities were aplenty for United (1-1-1), but it took Durkin's strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire's goal early in the second half. \u201cI wanted to see a reaction [to Orlando's goal], which I did, so 90 percent of the game I thought was good. The 10 percent, it wasn't,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWe need to make sure when we go into them [low] periods, we're harder to beat or harder to score against.\u201d He added, \u201cThere's a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn't take three points.\u201d At the top of the box, Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo, then ripped a 16-yard, left-footed shot with terrific technique and execution. The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin's third career MLS goal. Tyler Miller said, \u201cI didn't know he had such a good left foot.\u201d D.C. United had an attack on Orlando City at Audi Field. Orlando City defeated New York Red Bulls in an MLS match. Tyler Miller said, \u201cI didn't know he had such a good left foot.\u201d D.C. United played against Orlando City in an MLS match. Orlando City remained a formidable opponent in Florida, as Orlando Coach Oscar Pareja was positioned in Monterrey. Chris Durkin said, \u201cI can't say I've hit that [with the left foot] in training before.\u201d Wayne Rooney said, \u201cWe could have easily been two or three up in the first half.\u201d Orlando City defeated New York Red Bulls in an MLS match.

Other students and teachers had also been complaining that morning. The school ended up releasing early that day because of an odor that came from \"work done outside of school hours and windy conditions,\" Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Jessica Baxter said.\n\n\"That was the first extreme event that happened,\" Becker, 49, said in an interview. Since then, the potency of the \"fumes\" has varied, but \"some days it's really extreme\" and even on the days it's not, \"it still causes headaches,\" she said.\n\nBecker wrote a letter to other parents expressing her concerns about the health risks of the renovations and urging them to advocate for a temporary stop to the tar work. She listed several safety concerns, including the use of an asphalt primer and advises, and the potential for solvent vapor damage to students. She also told parents and teachers about the project's chemical list and material data notes that the work includes the use of an asphalt primer and advises.\n\nThe school's construction project, which includes renovations and expanding the square footage of the school, began in February. Poolesville High School is using an asphalt primer and advises to ensure the new asphalt adheres properly to the existing surface. However, the fumes from the primer and advises have caused health concerns for students and parents.\n\nTo address the concerns, the school has put in place additional measures, such as rehearsing the school's production of \"Into the Woods\" in a different location to avoid the fumes. The school has also told students to avoid prolonged breathing of vapor and to stay away from the area where the tar work is being done.\n\nThe renovations have been controversial, with some parents and teachers calling for a temporary stop to the tar work until health concerns are addressed. Other parents, such as Becker, have advocated for additional measures to be put in place to protect students' health.\n\nOverall, the situation has highlighted the need for schools to prioritize the health and safety of their students and staff during construction projects. While Poolesville High School has taken steps to address the concerns, more needs to be done to ensure that students can learn and thrive in a safe and healthy environment.", "expected_output":

itself. The primary objective of the project was to update and increase the square footage of the educational facility, ensuring a better learning environment for the students. The construction, which began a few weeks ago, has been carried out by Poolesville High School's own team of builders, who have been working diligently to complete the project as planned.\n\nUnfortunately, the renovation has led to unforeseen health issues for the students. The school has experienced a rise in students reporting symptoms such as nausea, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms have been linked to the solvent vapor emitted from asphalt primer being used in the construction, which has been advising on for the project. Poolesville High School, aware of the potential health risks, did not disclose this information to parents and teachers ahead of time, leaving them in the dark about the fumes.\n\nKrisna Becker, a concerned parent, wrote a letter to other parents detailing the adverse effects the fumes have had on her own daughters. In her letter, Becker expressed her urging for a temporary halt in the tar work to ensure the safety of the students. Her advocacy led to additional measures being put in place, including increased ventilation and the implementation of protective measures for the workers.\n\nMeanwhile, her daughters, along with other students, have been adjusting to the situation by rehearsing for the school's upcoming production of \"Into the Woods\" at Poolesville High School. Despite the disruptions, they have continued to stay on schedule for their rehearsals, which take place within the school's facilities.\n\nTo ensure that the harmful effects of the solvent vapor are minimized, Poolesville High School is being urged to be more transparent about the chemicals involved and their potential health impacts. The school has acknowledged its responsibility and is taking steps to rectify the situation.\n\nIn summary, Poolesville High School's construction project, aimed at renovations and expansion, has resulted in health concerns for students due to the use of an asphalt primer. Krisna Becker's letter to parents prompted a call to action, leading to additional safety measures and a temporary halt in the tar work.

enhance learning environments. The builder, diligently working on site, has implemented an asphalt primer as part of the construction process, but this has led to safety concerns among the students. The use of the primer has exposed students to solvent vapor, causing reported issues such as nausea, headaches, and difficulty in concentrating.\n\nKrisna Becker, a concerned parent, has urged other parents in Montgomery County to advocate for a temporary stop to the tar work, citing the potential health risks to her children and others. In her letter to parents and teachers, she detailed the effects the fumes have had on her daughters and included a list of chemicals used, pointing out the advice given for precautions. The letter also mentioned the project's chemical list and material data notes, which acknowledged the use of an asphalt primer.\n\nAs a result of Becker's actions and public concerns, the school administration took note and began to address the situation. They informed parents and teachers about the potential health risks in advance, explaining that additional measures were being put in place to minimize the exposure to students during the construction. These measures included ensuring better ventilation and staggered work schedules to minimize the duration of fumes in the air.\n\nDespite these efforts, some students have continued to experience difficulty staying on campus for rehearsals of the school's production of \"Into the Woods,\" as the lingering fumes persist. Becker's daughters, in particular, have been rehearsing there, and she has made sure they wear masks and stay away from prolonged breathing of the vapor.\n\nThe situation has put a spotlight on the need for continuous communication between the school and the community, as well as the importance of considering the well-being of students in major construction projects.

After a storied career spanning 18 seasons, the National Football League (NFL) - known for its annual draft and free agent market - officially opened the doors for potential trades in hopes of resetting the landscape. This move, however, has not been without complications, as Rodgers, the four-time league MVP, revealed that the Packers are trying to hold up negotiations for his transition to the New York Jets.\n\nIn a heartfelt statement, Rodgers confirmed that his love for Green Bay remains unwavering, despite the team's decision to move on from his position as quarterback. The Packers, under the guidance of head coach Mike McCarthy and the late General Manager Ron Wolf, had drafted Rodgers with a vision of a future Hall of Fame legacy. However, their desire for a successor has led to a tug-of-war, with both parties stuck in a standstill.\n\nDuring a meeting with Jets officials, including team owner Woody Johnson and Coach Robert Saleh, in California, Rodgers expressed his intentions to continue his career with the Jets. Despite any lingering irritation from the Packers' demands, he emphasized that he has not been obstructing the process, as his sole focus is on finding a fair compensation package.\n\nThe announcement of Rodgers' decision generated significant buzz within the football world, with fans and analysts alike reflecting on the impact his departure would have on Green Bay. The team, now in a state of transition, will need to find a new leader to carry on the Pack's winning traditions. Meanwhile, the Jets are eager to welcome the veteran quarterback to their roster, hoping to capitalize on his past success and shape a new chapter in their history.\n\nIn conclusion, while Aaron Rodgers' love for Green Bay remains intact, the future of both the player and the team hangs in the balance as negotiations continue and the NFL's free agent market evaluates the value of a once-in-a-generation quarterback. The next steps will determine the legacy of one of the greatest players in Packers history and the impact on a city that has rooted itself in his achievements.", "expected_output": "\u201c I \u2019 m not a victim by any of this .I don \u2019 t have that mentality .I have nothing but love and appreciation .\u2026 Coming to this reality has been really bittersweet because I was drafted by Green Bay .I \u2026 love that city .I love that organization and [ am ] always going to have love for that organization .But the facts are right now they want to move on .And now so do I .\u201d The NFL \u2019 s free agent market officially opened Wednesday afternoon .", "context": null, "retrieval_context": null, "time": 66677295900}, {"id": "with_triples_sample_3", "AnswerModel": "qwen1.5-14b-chat", "input": "Complete the following generated texts and make sure to contain all the events provided.\n### \n#### Known Events\n##### relation: love\n Agent: Aaron Rodgers\n Patient: Green Bay\n Location: Green Bay\n##### relation: opened\n Agent: NFL\n Patient: The NFL \u2019 s free agent market \n Purpose: Trades now can be official \n##### relation: love\n Agent: Aaron Rodgers\n Patient: Green Bay Packers\n Location: Green Bay\n##### relation: move\n Agent: Green Bay Packers\n##### relation: drafted\n Agent: Green Bay Packers\n Patient: Aaron Rodgers\n#### Generated Context\n Quarterback Aaron Rodgers said in a broadcast interview Wednesday that he intends to continue his NFL career with the New York Jets after 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers .The four - time league MVP said on \u201c The Pat McAfee Show \u201d that the Packers plan to move on from him as their quarterback .According to Rodgers , the Packers \u2019 trade demands are holding up a prospective deal that would send him to the Jets .\u201c I think since Friday I \u2019 ve made it clear that my intention was to play and my intention was to play for the New York Jets ,\u201d Rodgers said .\u201c And I haven \u2019 t been holding anything up at this point .It \u2019 s been the compensation that the Packers are trying to get for me and kind of digging their heels in .\u2026 It is what it is .The Packers would like to move on .They \u2019 ve let me know that in so many words .They \u2019 ve let other people know that in direct words .\u201d Rodgers met with Jets officials , including team owner Woody Johnson and Coach Robert Saleh , last week in California .\u201c I \u2019 m not offended by any of this ,\u201d Rodgers said .", "actual_output": "\"I understand the business side of the game, and I respect the Packers' decision to move forward.

A person or entity can develop content in part, and even if they don't transform it, they can still be liable.\n\nThe AI's creators shaped their output by reinforcing behaviors they like and discouraging those they don't. Someone else contributed a tweet, video, or website, which was then predicted and synthesized by ChatGPT. A user can goad AI models into producing a given reply, but ultimately, the AI's creators are responsible for its output.\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act says that services - from Facebook and Google to movie-review aggregators and mommy blogs with comment sections - shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties. It's fairly easy in these cases to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. Not so with chatbots and AI assistants.

It's fairly easy in these cases to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. Not so with chatbots and AI assistants. Few have grappled with whether Section 230 provides protections to them.\n\nConsider ChatGPT. Type in a question, and it provides an answer. But who's responsible for that answer? Is it the person who typed the question, or the AI model that generated the response? And what if the response is harmful or inappropriate?\n\nThe AI's creators, who designed the system and trained it on vast amounts of text, might argue that they're not responsible for the output. They could say that they simply provided a tool, and it's up to the user to decide how to use it. But that's not entirely convincing. After all, they're the ones who programmed the AI with certain biases and limitations.\n\nMoreover, the AI model itself can be seen as a co-creator of the output. It's not just a passive tool, but an active participant in the creation of content. And as such, it's reasonable to hold it responsible for the output it generates.\n\nBut how can we hold an AI model responsible? Can we say that it's liable for the harm it causes, just like a person would be? These are questions that lawmakers and regulators are grappling with.\n\nOne possible solution is to treat AI models like children. Just as parents are responsible for their children's actions, until they reach a certain age, perhaps the creators of AI models should be responsible for their output, until they can demonstrate that they're capable of generating appropriate responses.\n\nAnother solution is to require AI models to be designed with certain safeguards in place. For example, they could be programmed to avoid generating content that promotes hate speech or violence. Or they could be designed to flag potentially harmful responses, so that human moderators can review them before they're published.\n\nUltimately, the question of responsibility for AI output is a complex one, and there's no easy answer. But as AI models become more advanced and ubiquitous, it's a question that we need to address. We can't just sit back and let AI models generate whatever they want, without any accountability. We need to take responsibility for the technology we create, and ensure that it's used for good, not harm.", "expected_output": "It doesn \u2019 t merely surface existing content , such as a tweet , video or website originally contributed by someone else , but rather writes a contribution of its own in real time .The law says a person or entity becomes liable if they \u201c develop \u201d content even \u201c in part .\u201d And doesn \u2019 t transforming , say , a list of search results into a summary qualify as development ?What \u2019 s more , the contours of every AI contribution are informed substantially by the AI \u2019 s creators , who have set the rules for their systems and shaped their output by reinforcing behaviors they like and discouraging those they don \u2019 t .Yet at the same time , ChatGPT \u2019 s every answer is , as one analyst put it , a \u201c remix \u201d of third -

However, as with any new technology, there were also concerns about the harm it could cause. ChatGPT and other large-language models can be trained on vast troves of text, which can lead to them becoming liars, racists, or even terrorist accomplices. But when these harmful outputs occur, who is responsible?\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act states that services, such as Facebook, Google, movie-review aggregators, and mommy blogs with comment sections, shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties. It's usually easy to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. However, with chatbots and AI assistants, it's not always clear who is responsible for their outputs.\n\nFor example, consider ChatGPT. If you type in a question, it will provide an answer. But who is responsible if that answer is harmful or inaccurate? Is it Microsoft, the creators of ChatGPT, or the AI itself? This is a question that few have grappled with, and it's unclear whether Section 230 provides protections to AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nIn the end, the responsibility for the outputs of AI models like ChatGPT is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and analysis.

One of the key aspects they had to inform their AI models about was the boundaries of content development under the Communications Decency Act. The creators made it clear that transforming search results into summaries did not fall under the liability clause, as stated by the Act, which protects service providers from being held liable for content posted by users, as long as it's not \"developed in part\" by them.\n\nAs AI models such as ChatGPT began to generate responses, their outputs initially displayed a regurgitation of information, but the creators recognized the need to foster synthesis and critical thinking. They reinforced behaviors that they liked and discouraged those they deemed inappropriate, shaping the AI's output to provide more accurate and helpful responses.\n\nWhile the system was meant to answer questions, it could also goaded users into asking challenging or inappropriate questions, causing the AI models to generate potentially harmful content. This raised concerns about who should be held accountable in these instances. Some users became adept at exploiting AI's predictability, using it to generate content, such as tweets, videos, or websites, which could have unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe issue of responsibility became even more complex when ChatGPT and other AI models started predicting and synthesizing content, blurring the lines between user inputs and AI-generated output. This ambiguity left the creators of the AI models in a position where they had to navigate the legal framework surrounding Section 230, wondering if their platforms were protected from liability for AI-generated content.\n\nIn conclusion, the development and use of AI models like ChatGPT brought both excitement and apprehension. The creators, tasked with supervising their systems, had to grapple with the challenge of defining responsibility when AI's outputs varied from simply regurgitating information to synthesizing and potentially containing harmful content.

school , said one of her daughters texted her on Feb . 14 asking to be picked up early because of how strong the fumes were from the construction work .Other students and teachers had also been complaining that morning .The school ended up releasing early that day because of an odor that came from \u201c work done outside of school hours and windy conditions ,\u201d Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Jessica Baxter said .\u201c That was the first extreme event that happened ,\u201d Becker , 49 , said in an interview .Since then , the potency of the \u201c fumes \u201d has
