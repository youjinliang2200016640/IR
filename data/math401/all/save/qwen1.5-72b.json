Subtracting 9 from 17 gives us 8. \n\nMoving on to the tenths place, we have 8 and 9. Since 8 is less than 9, we need to borrow from the hundredths place. This means we subtract 1 from the 8 in the hundredths place and add 10 to the 8 in the tenths place. \n\nNow we have 18 and 9.

Since \u03c0 is approximately equal to 3.14, we can rewrite -10.0\u03c0 as -10.0 * 3.14, which equals -31.4. \n\nNext, we need to evaluate the sine function at -31.4. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle. \n\nIn this case, we can use the unit circle to evaluate the sine function. The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of the coordinate plane. The sine function is equal to the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle. \n\nSince -31.4 is equivalent to -10\u03c0 + 0.6\u03c0, we can use the unit circle to find the sine of -10\u03c0 + 0.6\u03c0. The point where the terminal side of this angle intersects the unit circle is (0, 1), which means the sine of -10\u03c0 + 0.6\u03c0 is 1. \n\nHowever, we need to evaluate the sine of -10.0\u03c0, not -10\u03c0 + 0.6\u03c0. Since -10.0\u03c0 is equivalent to -10\u03c0 + 0, we can use the unit circle to find the sine of -10\u03c0 + 0. The point where the terminal side of this angle intersects the unit circle is (0, 0), which means the sine of -10\u03c0 + 0 is 0. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"sin(-10.0\u03c0) = ?\" is 0.",
