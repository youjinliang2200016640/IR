According to the passage, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda is a combination of the Spanish names of human A and Mary, the parents of Jesus Christ.\n\nUsing world knowledge, we know that Jesus Christ is a religious figure in Christianity, and his parents are believed to have been Mary and Joseph (also known as Joseph of Nazareth). Therefore, we can infer that human A, the parent of Jesus Christ, is likely to have been born in Nazareth, which is a city in the Galilee region of Israel.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I can tell you that human A, the parent of Jesus Christ, was likely born in Nazareth, Israel.",

            "actual_output": "  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not explicitly stated where the human being was born. However, we can make an educated guess based on the context.\n\nAccording to the passage, the county was named after the human being who was killed leading his men at the Battle of Frenchtown during the War of 1812. The battle took place in 1813, and it is likely that the human being was born sometime before that.\n\nUsing world knowledge, we can look up the War of 1812 and find that it was fought between the United States and Great Britain from 1812 to 1815. We can also look up the Battle of Frenchtown, which took place on January 22, 1813, near the present-day city of Monroe, Michigan.\n\nGiven that the battle took place in Michigan and that the human being was killed leading his men at the battle, it is likely that the human being was born in the United States, possibly in the Great Lakes region or the Midwest. However, without further information, we cannot pinpoint the exact place of birth.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Which place was this human being born?\" is:\n\n* It is not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nNote: This answer is based on the assumption that the human being was born in the United States, as the passage only provides information about the county being named after the human being and does not provide any information about the human being's birthplace.",

Intuitively, I think the answer should be \"UK\", but there are no mentions of \"UK\" in the passage.\n\nDo you think there are some mention/entity-related answers, but not in the passage? Or do you think we should not answer the question?\n\nAnswer: This is the type of question a human would have difficulty answering without further context.  If this is an example of the types of questions you are going to have to answer, then I think you should do as a human would do and either obtain the context from the original author (if possible) or state that the question is ambiguous and cannot be answered.\n\nComment: I don't think the question is ambiguous. I think the answer is \"UK\". And I think the reason is that the QA system is supposed to have the knowledge of wikipedia, which contains the information of the allegiance of this country.\n\nComment: @coolqinfeng If you have the knowledge of wikipedia, then another type of question would be \"What is the capital of this country?\" However, that information is not present in the question.  My point is that you need to know what information you are allowed to use to answer the question.",
