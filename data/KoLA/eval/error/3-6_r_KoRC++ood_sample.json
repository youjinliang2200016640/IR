At the least, United plays hard for the former English superstar, whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans. On Saturday, for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season, United\u2019s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point. Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute, ending a night of frustration for goal-averse United in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City. Opportunities were aplenty for United (1-1-1), but it took Durkin\u2019s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire\u2019s goal early in the second half. \u201cI wanted to see a reaction [to Orlando\u2019s goal], which I did, so 90 percent of the game I thought was good. The 10 percent, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWe need to make sure when we go into them [low] periods, we\u2019re harder to beat or harder to score against.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn\u2019t take three points.\u201d At the top of the box, Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo, then ripped a 16-yard, left-footed shot with terrific technique and execution. The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin\u2019s third career MLS goal. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve hit that [with the left foot] in training before,\u201d the right-footed Durkin said, smiling. United goalkeeper Tyler Miller said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know he had such a good left foot. It was amazing.\u201d Aside from McGuire\u2019s goal, United was much tighter and tidier defensively than it was against Columbus last weekend. In the attack, however, it remained inefficient with scoring opportunities, and Rooney said, \u201cWe could have easily been two or three up in the first half.\u201d Orlando (1-0-2) played its first away match in league play after defeating the New York Red Bulls, 1-0, and drawing with FC Cincinnati, 0-0. At the moment, though, the Lions\u2019 priority is the Concacaf Champions League. The visit to Washington fell between legs of a round-of-16 series with Mexican power Tigres. A 0-0 draw in Monterrey, Mexico, on Tuesday positioned them well for the return match in Florida on Wednesday. With that in mind, Orlando Coach Oscar Pareja made six lineup changes Saturday. Through three matches this year, the Lions had not conceded a goal. United was coming off a scoreless effort at Columbus, and for the first time, attacker Ted Ku-DiPietro, the hero on opening night, was in the lineup, replacing Nigel Robertha (illness). Center back Derrick Williams and right back Ruan, a former Orlando player, also made their first starts. United set the terms but continued to labor in the box. In the 27th minute, Christian Benteke was alone 12 yards out after settling Durkin\u2019s cross, but with most of the net at his pleasure, he shot too close to Gallese, who made a reaction save. Seven minutes later, Gallese thwarted Ku-DiPietro\u2019s 12-yard one-timer.\n\nQuestion: What specific tournament or league did [human] participate in as a competitor?",
