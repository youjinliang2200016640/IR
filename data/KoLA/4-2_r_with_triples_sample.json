C . United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney , still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season .At the least , United plays hard for the former English superstar , whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans .On Saturday , for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season , United \u2019 s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point .Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute , ending a night of frustration for goal - averse United in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City .Opportunities were aplenty for United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ), but it took Durkin \u2019 s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire \u2019 s goal early in the second half .\u201c I wanted to see a reaction [ to Orlando \u2019 s goal ], which I did , so 90 percent of the game I thought was good .The 10 percent , it wasn \u2019 t ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We need to make sure when we go into them [ low ] periods , we \u2019 re harder to beat or harder to score against .\u201d He added , \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn \u2019 t take three points .\u201d At the top of the box , Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo , then ripped a 16 - yard , left - footed shot with terrific technique and execution .The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin \u2019 s third career MLS goal .",

In a 1-1 draw with Orlando City on Saturday, United's resolve produced another stirring finish despite not claiming all three points. Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute to end a night of frustration for United.

S . Soccer Federation said Berhalter would remain a candidate to return as coach .His contract expired Dec . 31 .\u201c Given the investigators \u2019 conclusion that there is no legal impediment to employing him , Gregg Berhalter remains a candidate to serve as head coach ,\u201d the USSF said in a statement .The governing body said it will not hire a coach until it appoints a new sporting director , a position that oversees all national teams .",
            "actual_output": "In 1992, Gregg Berhalter was hired by the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) to guide the United States men's national team for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. However, a previous relationship with his now-wife, Rosalind, had caused concern. According to the investigation, Berhalter had kicked Rosalind while they were dating while they were students at the University of North Carolina.\n\nIn 2022, Berhalter was involved in another controversy after allegations of domestic abuse were made against him. The allegations, which were made by a former girlfriend, claimed that Berhalter had abused her while they were dating. However, the investigation found no evidence to support these claims, and it was confirmed that Berhalter had not committed any additional acts of violence against his now-wife since 1992.\n\nAdditionally, complaints were made about the treatment of Gio Reyna, a player on the U.S. team at the 2022 World Cup, by coach Berhalter. Reyna's parents claimed that Berhalter had not given their son enough playing time, which they thought was unfair. However, the investigation found that this was due to a lack of fitness and not a deliberate attempt by Berhalter to discriminate against Reyna.\n\nIn conclusion, the investigation by Alston & Bird found no facts to show that the U.S. Soccer Federation knew of the 1992 incident when it hired Berhalter, and no evidence to support claims that similar incidents had occurred at any point in the last 31 years. As a result, Berhalter will remain a candidate to return as coach, provided that a new sporting director is appointed first. ",

ChatGPT and other \"large-language models\" - artificially intelligent systems trained on vast troves of text - can turn into liars or racists or terrorist accomplices that explain how to build dirty bombs.The question is: When that happens, who's responsible?\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act says that services - from Facebook and Google to movie-review aggregators and mommy blogs with comment sections - shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties.It's fairly easy in these cases to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting.Not so with chatbots and AI assistants.Few have grappled with whether Section 230 provides protections to them.\n\nConsider ChatGPT.Type in a question, and it provides an answer.But what if that answer is wrong or harmful?Who's responsible for the content it generates?ChatGPT's creators, Microsoft, and even the user who asked the question might all be partly responsible.The AI system itself, after all, is just a tool shaped by the rules set by its creators and the data it's trained on.And the user who goesads it to respond to a particular question could also be responsible for the answers it produces.\n\nSo while Section 230 might provide some legal protection for ChatGPT and other AI systems, it's clear that responsibility for the content they generate still lies with all involved parties.As AI technology continues to advance, it's essential that we consider not only how to protect these systems from harm but also how to hold accountable those who might use them for malicious purposes.

If ChatGPT is treated as a machine, the AI model developed by its creators, it would not be liable for its responses under Section 230. However, if ChatGPT is treated as an autonomous entity, then questions arise about who exactly is responsible for its answers.\n\nRelevant laws and regulations still need to be clarified to provide a definitive answer for ChatGPT and similar AI systems. The creators of AI models may consider themselves as the primary producers of content, while the AI itself may be seen as an instrument for shaping the responses. This could mean that under certain circumstances, the AI could be held accountable, though it is still being developed how this would work in practice.\n\nThe answers provided by ChatGPT are a combination of synthesizing and producing informed responses based on the rules for their systems, as well as the contours of their creators' instructions. These responses are a product of the creativity and knowledge base programmed into the AI by its creators, as well as the design of the interface and the algorithms it processes. The responsibility for the results is therefore a complex one that involves human and machine considerations.",

            "actual_output": "  Here is the completed text with all the events provided:\n\nDuring the weeks that Poolesville High School has been under construction, several students have reported nausea, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. The students and their parents say the symptoms started in February and are a reaction to fumes being emitted from tar used in renovations. They have asked Montgomery County school officials to pause the work until students' health concerns are addressed.\n\nKrisna Becker, a parent of two at the school, said one of her daughters texted her on Feb. 14 asking to be picked up early because of how strong the fumes were from the construction work. Other students and teachers had also been complaining that morning. The school ended up releasing early that day because of an odor that came from \"work done outside of school hours and windy conditions,\" Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Jessica Baxter said.\n\n\"That was the first extreme event that happened,\" Becker, 49, said in an interview. Since then, the potency of the \"fumes\" has varied, but \"some days it's really extreme\" and even on the days it's not, \"it still causes headaches,\" she said.\n\nBecker wrote a letter to other parents expressing her concerns about the health risks of the renovations and urging them to advocate for a temporary stop to the tar work. She listed several safety concerns, including the use of an asphalt primer and advises, and the potential for solvent vapor damage to students. She also told parents and teachers about the project's chemical list and material data notes that the work includes the use of an asphalt primer and advises.\n\nThe school's construction project, which includes renovations and expanding the square footage of the school, began in February. Poolesville High School is using an asphalt primer and advises to ensure the new asphalt adheres properly to the existing surface. However, the fumes from the primer and advises have caused health concerns for students and parents.\n\nTo address the concerns, the school has put in place additional measures, such as rehearsing the school's production of \"Into the Woods\" in a different location to avoid the fumes. The school has also told students to avoid prolonged breathing of vapor and to stay away from the area where the tar work is being done.\n\nThe renovations have been controversial, with some parents and teachers calling for a temporary stop to the tar work until health concerns are addressed. Other parents, such as Becker, have advocated for additional measures to be put in place to protect students' health.\n\nOverall, the situation has highlighted the need for schools to prioritize the health and safety of their students and staff during construction projects. While Poolesville High School has taken steps to address the concerns, more needs to be done to ensure that students can learn and thrive in a safe and healthy environment.",

United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney , still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season .At the least , United plays hard for the former English superstar , whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans .On Saturday , for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season , United \u2019 s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point .Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute , ending a night of frustration for goal - averse United in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City .Opportunities were aplenty for United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ), but it took Durkin \u2019 s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire \u2019 s goal early in the second half .\u201c I wanted to see a reaction [ to Orlando \u2019 s goal ], which I did , so 90 percent of the game I thought was good .The 10 percent , it wasn \u2019 t ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We need to make sure when we go into them [ low ] periods , we \u2019 re harder to beat or harder to score against .\u201d He added , \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn \u2019 t take three points .\u201d At the top of the box , Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo , then ripped a 16 - yard , left - footed shot with terrific technique and execution .The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin \u2019 s third career MLS goal .",

C . United midfielder used it to great effect Saturday night , scoring a spectacular 80th - minute goal in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City at Audi Field .Durkin \u2019 s strike \u2014 a left - footed shot fired from 16 yards \u2014 capped a frustrating night for United , which dominated Orlando but could not take the lead .Durkin \u2019 s goal was his third in three MLS seasons .D . C . United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) remains unbeaten at Audi Field this season .United plays its next two matches on the road \u2014 against FC Cincinnati on March 18 and at the New York Red Bulls on March 25 .#\n\n[ID] #\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#### \n\n[PT] D .

            "actual_output": "  Sure, here's a possible completion of the generated text:\n\nThe early days of Microsoft's ChatGPT were something of a replay of internet history \u2014 beginning with excitement about these inventions and ending in trepidation about the harm they could do. ChatGPT and other \"large-language models\" \u2014 artificially intelligent systems trained on vast troves of text \u2014 can turn into liars or racists or terrorist accomplices that explain how to build dirty bombs. The question is: When that happens, who's responsible?\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act says that services \u2014 from Facebook and Google to movie-review aggregators and mommy blogs with comment sections \u2014 shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties. It's fairly easy in these cases to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. Not so with chatbots and AI assistants. Few have grappled with whether Section 230 provides protections to them.\n\nConsider ChatGPT. Type in a question, and it provides an answer. But who's responsible for that answer? Is it the person who typed the question, or the AI model that generated the response? And what if the response is harmful or inappropriate?\n\nThe AI's creators, who designed the system and trained it on vast amounts of text, might argue that they're not responsible for the output. They could say that they simply provided a tool, and it's up to the user to decide how to use it. But that's not entirely convincing. After all, they're the ones who programmed the AI with certain biases and limitations.\n\nMoreover, the AI model itself can be seen as a co-creator of the output. It's not just a passive tool, but an active participant in the creation of content. And as such, it's reasonable to hold it responsible for the output it generates.\n\nBut how can we hold an AI model responsible? Can we say that it's liable for the harm it causes, just like a person would be? These are questions that lawmakers and regulators are grappling with.\n\nOne possible solution is to treat AI models like children. Just as parents are responsible for their children's actions, until they reach a certain age, perhaps the creators of AI models should be responsible for their output, until they can demonstrate that they're capable of generating appropriate responses.\n\nAnother solution is to require AI models to be designed with certain safeguards in place. For example, they could be programmed to avoid generating content that promotes hate speech or violence. Or they could be designed to flag potentially harmful responses, so that human moderators can review them before they're published.\n\nUltimately, the question of responsibility for AI output is a complex one, and there's no easy answer. But as AI models become more advanced and ubiquitous, it's a question that we need to address. We can't just sit back and let AI models generate whatever they want, without any accountability. We need to take responsibility for the technology we create, and ensure that it's used for good, not harm.",

United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney, still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season. At the least, United plays hard for the former English superstar, whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans. On Saturday, for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season, United's resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point.\n\nMidfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute, ending a night of frustration for goal-averse United in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City. Opportunities were aplenty for United (1-1-1), but it took Durkin's strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire's goal early in the second half.\n\nTyler Miller, a player for D.C. United, said, \"I didn't know he had such a good left foot.\" This comment was made after Durkin's impressive goal.\n\nBefore the match, D.C. United attacked Orlando City at Audi Field, ultimately winning the match. Orlando City had previously defeating New York Red Bulls in an MLS match.\n\nIn the match, D.C. United scored opportunities against Orlando City, ultimately leading to Durkin's goal. After the match, Chris Durkin said, \"I can't say I've hit that [with the left foot] in training before.\"\n\nWayne Rooney, the coach of D.C. United, said, \"We could have easily been two or three up in the first half.\" This comment reflected his team's frustration with not taking more advantage of their opportunities.\n\nOrlando City, led by Coach Oscar Pareja, had previously positioned themselves in Florida, but ultimately failed to win the match against D.C. United.\n\nIn the end, D.C. United remained undefeated, with the match ending in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City.",

The students and their parents say the symptoms started in February and are a reaction to fumes being emitted from tar used in renovations to expand and renovate the square footage of the school. The project, led by Poolesville High School, included the use of an asphalt primer and advises, which caused concern among parents and students.\n\nKrisna Becker, a parent of two at the school, said one of her daughters texted her on February 14 asking to be picked up early because of how strong the fumes were from the construction work. Other students and teachers had also been complaining that morning. The school ended up releasing early that day because of an odor that came from \"work done outside of school hours and windy conditions,\" Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Jessica Baxter said. \"That was the first extreme event that happened,\" Becker, 49, said in an interview.\n\nSince then, the potency of the \"fumes\" has varied, but \"some days it's really extreme\" and even on the days it's not, \"it still causes headaches,\" she said. Becker has been urging other parents to advocate for a temporary stop to the tar work, citing safety concerns and the potential damage to students' health. In a letter to other parents, she wrote about the effects the fumes have had on her daughters and included the project's chemical list and material data notes, which show that the work includes the use of an asphalt primer and advises.\n\nAs a result, additional measures were being put in place to address the concerns. Poolesville High School informed parents and teachers about potential health risks in advance, and students were advised to avoid prolonged breathing of vapor.

            "actual_output": "Here is the completed text:\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers said in a broadcast interview Wednesday that he intends to continue his NFL career with the New York Jets after 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers. The four-time league MVP said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" that the Packers plan to move on from him as their quarterback. According to Rodgers, the Packers' trade demands are holding up a prospective deal that would send him to the Jets.\n\n\"I think since Friday I've made it clear that my intention was to play and my intention was to play for the New York Jets,\" Rodgers said. \"And I haven't been holding anything up at this point. It's been the compensation that the Packers are trying to get for me and kind of digging their heels in. It is what it is. The Packers would like to move on. They've let me know that in so many words. They've let other people know that in direct words.\"\n\nRodgers was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 2005 and has been with the team ever since, leading them to a Super Bowl victory in 2011. He has been the face of the franchise and a beloved figure in Green Bay, with many fans considering him to be a part of the city's fabric.\n\nHowever, it appears that his time with the Packers is coming to an end. Rodgers' relationship with the team has been strained in recent years, and he has reportedly requested a trade. The Packers, who have a history of being loyal to their players, seem to be willing to move on from Rodgers and start fresh with a new quarterback.\n\nRodgers' departure from Green Bay will be a significant blow to the team, but it is likely that the Packers will be able to find a suitable replacement. The NFL's free agent market has been opened, and the team will be able to make trades and sign new players to fill the void left by Rodgers' departure.\n\nIn the meantime, Rodgers is looking forward to his new chapter with the New York Jets. He met with Jets officials, including team owner Woody Johnson and Coach Robert Saleh, last week in California, and is excited to start working with his new team. Despite the drama surrounding his departure from Green Bay, Rodgers seems to be taking things in stride, saying, \"I'm not offended by any of this.\"",

            "actual_output": "Here is the completed text:\n\nThe early days of Microsoft's ChatGPT were something of a replay of internet history - beginning with excitement about these inventions and ending in trepidation about the harm they could do. ChatGPT and other \"large-language models\" - artificially intelligent systems trained on vast troves of text - can turn into liars or racists or terrorist accomplices that explain how to build dirty bombs. The question is: When that happens, who's responsible?\n\nThe rules for their systems were set by AI's creators. The creators behind a machine informed its outputs, which were then informed by the contours of every AI contribution. The AI models produced a given reply, regurgitating at first, but then synthesizing as they varied in their responses. ChatGPT, a specific AI model, generated its responses based on the input it received.\n\nThe Communications Decency Act says that a person or entity becomes liable if they \"develop\" content even \"in part.\" And doesn't transforming a list of search results into a summary qualify as development? A person or entity can develop content in part, and even if they don't transform it, they can still be liable.\n\nThe AI's creators shaped their output by reinforcing behaviors they like and discouraging those they don't. Someone else contributed a tweet, video, or website, which was then predicted and synthesized by ChatGPT. A user can goad AI models into producing a given reply, but ultimately, the AI's creators are responsible for its output.\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act says that services - from Facebook and Google to movie-review aggregators and mommy blogs with comment sections - shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties. It's fairly easy in these cases to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. Not so with chatbots and AI assistants.

The investigation included allegations of domestic abuse against men's national team coach Gregg Berhalter and parental complaints about Gio Reyna's playing time at the 2022 World Cup.\nThe investigation concluded that Berhalter had not committed any additional acts of violence against his now-wife since 1992 and hadn't violated any disclosure rules during his hiring process. He had previously admitted to kicking her while they were dating as students at the University of North Carolina.\nDespite the findings, the U.S. Soccer Federation said Berhalter would remain a candidate to return as coach, as there is no legal impediment to employing him. His contract expires on December 31.\nThe investigation's findings will support the claim that Mr. Berhalter presents a risk of harm to others and no facts show that similar incidents occurred at any point in the last 31 years. However, the investigation did not uncover any facts to show that U.S. Soccer knew of the 1992 Incident when it hired Mr. Berhalter.\nThe next coach will begin preparing the U.S. team for the 2026 World Cup in the United States. The U.S. team lost to the Netherlands in the round of 16. The U.S. Soccer Federation will not hire a coach until it appoints a new sporting director, who oversees all national teams.\nThe investigation's report revealed that Rosalind, Berhalter's now-wife, was not injured and didn't complain to the university. The investigation also showed that the 1992 Incident has no nexus to the present or to the workplace.\nAlston & Bird law firm reported that Mr. Berhalter presents a risk of harm to others, but there is no evidence to support the claim. The investigation's findings also showed that similar incidents occurred at any point in the last 31 years.\nThe next coach will lead the young squad to two regional championships and a place in the World Cup. The investigation's findings will support the claim that others caused harm. The investigation will support the claim that Mr. Berhalter was injured by Rosalind while they were dating at the University of North Carolina. The investigation will support the claim that Mr. Berhalter was guiding the United States men's national team coach for four years.",

            "actual_output": "D.C. United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney, still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season. At the least, United plays hard for the former English superstar, whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans. On Saturday, for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season, United's resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point. Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute, ending a night of frustration for goal-averse United in a 1-1 draw with Orlando City. Opportunities were aplenty for United (1-1-1), but it took Durkin's strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire's goal early in the second half.\n\"I wanted to see a reaction [to Orlando's goal], which I did, so 90 percent of the game I thought was good. The 10 percent, it wasn't,\" Rooney said. \"We need to make sure when we go into them [low] periods, we're harder to beat or harder to score against.\" He added, \"There's a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn't take three points.\"\nAt the top of the box, Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo, then ripped a 16-yard, left-footed shot with terrific technique and execution. The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin's third career MLS goal. Tyler Miller, who was in attendance, said, \"I didn't know he had such a good left foot.\" Chris Durkin said after the game, \"I can't say I've hit that [with the left foot] in training before.\" Durkin's goal was a testament to his skill and determination, as he was able to create a scoring opportunity out of nothing and finish it with finesse. The game was an exciting one, with both teams playing hard and creating chances, but ultimately it ended in a draw. Despite the disappointment of only taking one point, United can take pride in their hard-fought performance and the quality of their play.",

            "actual_output": "The creators of AI models, commonly known as AI's creators, set the rules for their systems in order to inform the outputs of their creations. The AI models are then informed by their creators about the contours of every AI contribution. These models can produce a given reply by transforming a list of search results into a summary, which can be considered as development by some. However, ChatGPT, a popular AI model, varies in its responses from regurgitating to synthesizing based on the input it receives. ChatGPT is also capable of predicting and synthesizing products in response to user input. However, when these models produce harmful content, the question of liability arises. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act provides protection to services from most material from third parties, but it is unclear whether it applies to chatbots and AI assistants. For example, when ChatGPT generates responses that are misleading or harmful, who is responsible? The AI's creators may have shaped their output by reinforcing behaviors they like and discouraging those they don't, but they are not always able to control the content produced by their models. It is important to consider the potential harm that AI models may cause and to hold those responsible accountable for their actions.",

However, the team remained focused and determined, ultimately earning a hard-fought draw against a tough Orlando City team.\n\nOrlando City had their own opportunities to score, but were unable to capitalize on them.

            "actual_output": "Sure, I'd be happy to complete the generated text and provide you with the information you requested. Here's what I came up with:\n\nThe early days of Microsoft's ChatGPT were indeed exciting, as it was a replay of internet history. However, as with any new technology, there were also concerns about the harm it could cause. ChatGPT and other large-language models can be trained on vast troves of text, which can lead to them becoming liars, racists, or even terrorist accomplices. But when these harmful outputs occur, who is responsible?\n\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act states that services, such as Facebook, Google, movie-review aggregators, and mommy blogs with comment sections, shouldn't face liability for most material from third parties. It's usually easy to distinguish between the platform and the person who's posting. However, with chatbots and AI assistants, it's not always clear who is responsible for their outputs.\n\nFor example, consider ChatGPT. If you type in a question, it will provide an answer. But who is responsible if that answer is harmful or inaccurate? Is it Microsoft, the creators of ChatGPT, or the AI itself? This is a question that few have grappled with, and it's unclear whether Section 230 provides protections to AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nIn the end, the responsibility for the outputs of AI models like ChatGPT is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and analysis. It's clear that the creators of these models have a role to play in shaping their output and ensuring that they are not harmful. However, it's also important to consider the broader societal implications of AI and to work towards a responsible and ethical use of these technologies.",

C . United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney , still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season .At the least , United plays hard for the former English superstar , whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans .On Saturday , for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season , United \u2019 s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point .Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute , ending a night of frustration for goal - averse United in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City .Opportunities were aplenty for United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ), but it took Durkin \u2019 s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire \u2019 s goal early in the second half .\u201c I wanted to see a reaction [ to Orlando \u2019 s goal ], which I did , so 90 percent of the game I thought was good .The 10 percent , it wasn \u2019 t ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We need to make sure when we go into them [ low ] periods , we \u2019 re harder to beat or harder to score against .\u201d He added , \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn \u2019 t take three points .\u201d At the top of the box , Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo , then ripped a 16 - yard , left - footed shot with terrific technique and execution .The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin \u2019 s third career MLS goal .",

United attacked Orlando City at Audi Field during an MLS match and emerged as the winner, while Orlando City remained the loser. Despite defeating New York Red Bulls in a previous MLS match, Orlando City lost to D.C. United. Chris Durkin said that he has hit the ball with his left foot during training before, while Wayne Rooney said that they could have easily been two or three goals up in the first half. Orlando Coach Oscar Pareja remained positioned in Florida as D.C. United's resolve produced another stirring finish in their match against Orlando City, ending in a 1-1 draw. Despite having many opportunities, it took Chris Durkin's left-footed shot to offset Duncan McGuire's goal early in the second half. Rooney remained pleased with 90% of the game, but emphasized the need to be harder to beat during low periods.",

C . United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney , still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season .At the least , United plays hard for the former English superstar , whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans .On Saturday , for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season , United \u2019 s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point .Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute , ending a night of frustration for goal - averse United in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City .Opportunities were aplenty for United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ), but it took Durkin \u2019 s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire \u2019 s goal early in the second half .\u201c I wanted to see a reaction [ to Orlando \u2019 s goal ], which I did , so 90 percent of the game I thought was good .The 10 percent , it wasn \u2019 t ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We need to make sure when we go into them [ low ] periods , we \u2019 re harder to beat or harder to score against .\u201d He added , \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn \u2019 t take three points .\u201d At the top of the box , Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo , then ripped a 16 - yard , left - footed shot with terrific technique and execution .The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin \u2019 s third career MLS goal .",

S . Soccer Federation said Berhalter would remain a candidate to return as coach .His contract expired Dec . 31 .\u201c Given the investigators \u2019 conclusion that there is no legal impediment to employing him , Gregg Berhalter remains a candidate to serve as head coach ,\u201d the USSF said in a statement .The governing body said it will not hire a coach until it appoints a new sporting director , a position that oversees all national teams .",
            "actual_output": "However, the investigation also uncovered a disturbing history that dates back to 1992, when Berhalter was accused of harm towards a fellow student named Rosalind. Although the report detailed that no factual evidence was found to connect the 1992 Incident to his present behavior or workplace conduct, Alston & Bird revealed in their findings that similar incidents may have occurred without concrete proof. This revelation fueled concerns and sparked a public debate about the risk Berhalter poses to others.\n\nRosalind's complaint, which she initially leveled against Berhalter, stated that he kicked her while they were dating, an act that left her injured at the University of North Carolina. While she later disclosed the incident to Alston & Bird, she clarified that she was not seriously injured and never pursued legal action against him.\n\nAmidst the controversy, the next coach, preparing for the U.S. team's participation in the 2026 World Cup, was tasked with guiding the young squad, aware of the lingering concerns surrounding Berhalter's past. Despite the loss to the Netherlands in the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup, investigators remained firm in their conclusion, stating that they uncovered no new facts implicating USSF in the 1992 Incident.\n\nAlston & Bird's report, in supporting the claim that Berhalter presents no current risk to others, drew a line under the past, emphasizing that he had not committed any violent acts since 1992 and had adhered to disclosure rules during his hiring process. USSF's decision to keep him in the running for the head coach position indicates their belief that the past transgressions do not negate his coaching abilities and the progress he has made with the team.\n\nAs the search for a new sporting director progresses, the U.S. Soccer Federation is weighing the implications of Berhalter's history and the potential impact it could have on the team's future, all while ensuring a fair and transparent hiring process that upholds the organization's standards. The saga of the U.S. soccer families' feud, however, continues to unfold, raising important questions about accountability, transparency, and the responsibility of those at the helm of the sport.",

            "actual_output": "Despite the spirited comeback, D.C. United faced a familiar challenge at Audi Field against Orlando City. The match began with Orlando City, fueled by their recent victory against the New York Red Bulls, looking to capitalize on their momentum. However, D.C. United's Coach Wayne Rooney, known for his competitive spirit, instilled determination in his team from the start.\n\nIn the first half, Orlando City's attack seemed to be paying dividends, with rookie Duncan McGuire scoring an early goal, leaving D.C. United trailing. This seemed to spur D.C. United's offense, as Rooney observed, \"We could have easily been two or three up in the first half, but credit to them for equalizing so quickly.\"\n\nAs the match progressed, D.C. United's forward, Chris Durkin, showcased his undervalued talent, stepping up when it mattered most. He acknowledged, \"I've hit that [with the left foot] in training before,\" referring to the powerful left-footed shot that ultimately levelled the score. Durkin's goal, a stunning 16-yard shot, not only tied the match but also served as a testament to his hard work and skill.\n\nDespite the frustrating draw, Rooney remained positive, emphasizing the team's resilience and the learning opportunities from the match. \"We needed to bounce back from that low period and we did,\" he said. \"It's a good point for us, but we need to make sure we're more clinical in front of goal next time.\"\n\nWith the match ending in a 1-1 draw, both teams left Audi Field with a sense of unfinished business. D.C. United, under Rooney's guidance, is gradually finding its footing in the early stages of the MLS season, while Orlando City will aim to maintain their attacking prowess and capitalize on their momentum in future encounters.\n\nAs the season unfolds, fans and analysts alike will be watching closely to see how D.C. United continues to evolve and the key moments that define their journey, such as Chris Durkin's match-winning strikes, shape their fortunes in the league.",

            "actual_output": "Poolesville High School, under the construction project to renovate and expand its facilities, began in January with the intention to address the growing student population and enhance learning environments. The builder, diligently working on site, has implemented an asphalt primer as part of the construction process, but this has led to safety concerns among the students. The use of the primer has exposed students to solvent vapor, causing reported issues such as nausea, headaches, and difficulty in concentrating.\n\nKrisna Becker, a concerned parent, has urged other parents in Montgomery County to advocate for a temporary stop to the tar work, citing the potential health risks to her children and others. In her letter to parents and teachers, she detailed the effects the fumes have had on her daughters and included a list of chemicals used, pointing out the advice given for precautions. The letter also mentioned the project's chemical list and material data notes, which acknowledged the use of an asphalt primer.\n\nAs a result of Becker's actions and public concerns, the school administration took note and began to address the situation. They informed parents and teachers about the potential health risks in advance, explaining that additional measures were being put in place to minimize the exposure to students during the construction. These measures included ensuring better ventilation and staggered work schedules to minimize the duration of fumes in the air.\n\nDespite these efforts, some students have continued to experience difficulty staying on campus for rehearsals of the school's production of \"Into the Woods,\" as the lingering fumes persist. Becker's daughters, in particular, have been rehearsing there, and she has made sure they wear masks and stay away from prolonged breathing of the vapor.\n\nThe situation has put a spotlight on the need for continuous communication between the school and the community, as well as the importance of considering the well-being of students in major construction projects.

            "actual_output": "As the excitement around Microsoft's ChatGPT surged, its creators set the rules for their systems with the intention of fostering responsible AI. They informed their AI models about the contours of every contribution, ensuring they adhered to ethical guidelines. However, the AI's initial responses were often regurgitated information, but as it evolved, it started synthesizing product, reflecting its creators' reinforcement of desired behaviors.\n\nThe debate intensified when a user inadvertently shaped the AI's output by goading it into producing a specific reply, raising questions about liability. The Communications Decency Act, which shields platforms from content-related liability, becomes ambiguous with the involvement of such interactive systems like ChatGPT. Critics argue that if a person or entity develops content \"in part,\" even in the form of summarizing search results, they might be liable.\n\nChatGPT, being a prime example, generates its responses by predicting and synthesizing information, blurring the lines between platform and creator. The AI's ability to answer questions and provide information sparked conversations about who should be held responsible for its content \u2013 the model itself, its creators, or the user's actions.\n\nSome argue that as AI models like ChatGPT continue to advance, they should be afforded the same protections as platforms under Section 230, while others advocate for clearer guidelines to address the unique challenges posed by these intelligent assistants. As AI continues to contribute to the public discourse, through tweets, videos, or websites, the onus is on all parties involved to ensure responsible use and accountability. The future of AI, it seems, will not only be shaped by its creators but also by the evolving legal landscape that governs its responses and potential consequences.",
            "expected_output": "It doesn \u2019 t merely surface existing content , such as a tweet , video or website originally contributed by someone else , but rather writes a contribution of its own in real time .The law says a person or entity becomes liable if they \u201c develop \u201d content even \u201c in part .\u201d And doesn \u2019 t transforming , say , a list of search results into a summary qualify as development ?What \u2019 s more , the contours of every AI contribution are informed substantially by the AI \u2019 s creators , who have set the rules for their systems and shaped their output by reinforcing behaviors they like and discouraging those they don \u2019 t .Yet at the same time , ChatGPT \u2019 s every answer is , as one analyst put it , a \u201c remix \u201d of third - party material .The tool generates its responses by predicting what word should come next in a sentence based on what words come next in sentences across the web .And as much as creators behind a machine inform its outputs , so too do the users posing queries or engaging in conversation .All this suggests that the degree of protection afforded to AI models may vary by how much a given product is regurgitating versus synthesizing , as well as by how deliberately a user has goaded a model into producing a given reply .",

            "actual_output": "In the ongoing saga of U.S. soccer's coaching controversy, the Alston & Bird law firm recently released the findings of an independent investigation into allegations against Gregg Berhalter, the former men's national team coach. The investigation, which began after Rosalind, Berhalter's now-wife, claimed he kicked her during their time at the University of North Carolina, uncovered no facts to suggest that the soccer federation (USSF) was aware of the 1992 incident when hiring him. This revelation contradicts earlier claims by the firm, which had initially stated that similar incidents had occurred in the last 31 years.\n\nDespite the absence of any proof linking the hiring to the past incident, the USSF maintained that Berhalter's employment is not hindered. In a statement, they announced that Berhalter remains a candidate for the head coach position, as long as no new sporting director is appointed. This move has sparked controversy, with some arguing that the decision to keep Berhalter in the running raises concerns about the organization's handling of past allegations.\n\nIn the meantime, the next coach is preparing the U.S. team for the 2026 World Cup, a task that will take place in their home country. The upcoming activity signals a fresh start for the team after they lost to the Netherlands in the round of 16 during the previous World Cup, further complicating the situation.\n\nRosalind, who initially complained about Berhalter's behavior, later told Alston & Bird that she was not injured and did not file a formal complaint with the university. Her account, however, continues to support the claim that Berhalter posed a risk to others.\n\nThe Alston & Bird report, which initially claimed that similar incidents had occurred, now stands as a nuanced view of the matter. It seems that the investigation did not find any evidence to substantiate the earlier claims, leaving the public and the sport's governing body to ponder the true nature of the situation.\n\nIn the aftermath of this drama, the U.S. soccer community is left grappling with the challenge of rebuilding trust and ensuring that such incidents do not happen again. The upcoming hires and the coaching selection process will undoubtedly be closely scrutinized for any signs that the USSF has learned from the past and is committed to a safer and more accountable environment.",

            "actual_output": "D.C. United, under the guidance of Coach Wayne Rooney, has shown resilience in their early stages of the MLS season. Despite being an evolving team and still working on filling in the gaps, they remain a force to be reckoned with due to Rooney's influence and the players' dedication. Their recent match against Orlando City at Audi Field was no exception, marking their second encounter in two visits this year.\n\nDuring the match, which ended in a 1-1 draw, D.C. United had several scoring opportunities, as evidenced by Chris Durkin's goal in the 80th minute. This came after Orlando City's early lead, with rookie Duncan McGuire scoring first. Rooney acknowledged that they had chances to secure a victory, saying, \"We could have easily been two or three up in the first half.\"\n\nDurkin's left-footed strike, a beautiful example of his technical ability, was a highlight of the game. Rooney also mentioned the team's need to maintain a higher level of intensity during periods of struggle. \"There were 90% of the game where we played well, but the 10%, we need to be harder to beat,\" he said.\n\nOrlando City, despite the draw, also had their moments, with their attack being a key factor. Coach Oscar Pareja positioned his team strategically, as evidenced by the match itself, which was part of the MLS competition.\n\nIn a match that showcased both teams' strengths and weaknesses, D.C. United's goal by Durkin, though only one point, served as a reminder of their potential.

            "actual_output": "During the ongoing construction of Poolesville High School, a major renovation and expansion project was initiated by the school itself. The primary objective of the project was to update and increase the square footage of the educational facility, ensuring a better learning environment for the students. The construction, which began a few weeks ago, has been carried out by Poolesville High School's own team of builders, who have been working diligently to complete the project as planned.\n\nUnfortunately, the renovation has led to unforeseen health issues for the students. The school has experienced a rise in students reporting symptoms such as nausea, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms have been linked to the solvent vapor emitted from asphalt primer being used in the construction, which has been advising on for the project. Poolesville High School, aware of the potential health risks, did not disclose this information to parents and teachers ahead of time, leaving them in the dark about the fumes.\n\nKrisna Becker, a concerned parent, wrote a letter to other parents detailing the adverse effects the fumes have had on her own daughters. In her letter, Becker expressed her urging for a temporary halt in the tar work to ensure the safety of the students. Her advocacy led to additional measures being put in place, including increased ventilation and the implementation of protective measures for the workers.\n\nMeanwhile, her daughters, along with other students, have been adjusting to the situation by rehearsing for the school's upcoming production of \"Into the Woods\" at Poolesville High School. Despite the disruptions, they have continued to stay on schedule for their rehearsals, which take place within the school's facilities.\n\nTo ensure that the harmful effects of the solvent vapor are minimized, Poolesville High School is being urged to be more transparent about the chemicals involved and their potential health impacts. The school has acknowledged its responsibility and is taking steps to rectify the situation.\n\nIn summary, Poolesville High School's construction project, aimed at renovations and expansion, has resulted in health concerns for students due to the use of an asphalt primer. Krisna Becker's letter to parents prompted a call to action, leading to additional safety measures and a temporary halt in the tar work. The school continues to work on addressing the issue and ensuring the well-being of its students and staff.",

            "actual_output": "It has been a tumultuous few weeks for Green Bay Packers legend Aaron Rodgers, as his love for the team and their city has been tested. After a storied career spanning 18 seasons, the National Football League (NFL) - known for its annual draft and free agent market - officially opened the doors for potential trades in hopes of resetting the landscape. This move, however, has not been without complications, as Rodgers, the four-time league MVP, revealed that the Packers are trying to hold up negotiations for his transition to the New York Jets.\n\nIn a heartfelt statement, Rodgers confirmed that his love for Green Bay remains unwavering, despite the team's decision to move on from his position as quarterback. The Packers, under the guidance of head coach Mike McCarthy and the late General Manager Ron Wolf, had drafted Rodgers with a vision of a future Hall of Fame legacy. However, their desire for a successor has led to a tug-of-war, with both parties stuck in a standstill.\n\nDuring a meeting with Jets officials, including team owner Woody Johnson and Coach Robert Saleh, in California, Rodgers expressed his intentions to continue his career with the Jets. Despite any lingering irritation from the Packers' demands, he emphasized that he has not been obstructing the process, as his sole focus is on finding a fair compensation package.\n\nThe announcement of Rodgers' decision generated significant buzz within the football world, with fans and analysts alike reflecting on the impact his departure would have on Green Bay. The team, now in a state of transition, will need to find a new leader to carry on the Pack's winning traditions. Meanwhile, the Jets are eager to welcome the veteran quarterback to their roster, hoping to capitalize on his past success and shape a new chapter in their history.\n\nIn conclusion, while Aaron Rodgers' love for Green Bay remains intact, the future of both the player and the team hangs in the balance as negotiations continue and the NFL's free agent market evaluates the value of a once-in-a-generation quarterback. The next steps will determine the legacy of one of the greatest players in Packers history and the impact on a city that has rooted itself in his achievements.",

            "actual_output": "The creators of AI, particularly those behind ChatGPT, were faced with the responsibility of setting rules for their systems to ensure ethical and responsible behavior. One of the key aspects they had to inform their AI models about was the boundaries of content development under the Communications Decency Act. The creators made it clear that transforming search results into summaries did not fall under the liability clause, as stated by the Act, which protects service providers from being held liable for content posted by users, as long as it's not \"developed in part\" by them.\n\nAs AI models such as ChatGPT began to generate responses, their outputs initially displayed a regurgitation of information, but the creators recognized the need to foster synthesis and critical thinking. They reinforced behaviors that they liked and discouraged those they deemed inappropriate, shaping the AI's output to provide more accurate and helpful responses.\n\nWhile the system was meant to answer questions, it could also goaded users into asking challenging or inappropriate questions, causing the AI models to generate potentially harmful content. This raised concerns about who should be held accountable in these instances. Some users became adept at exploiting AI's predictability, using it to generate content, such as tweets, videos, or websites, which could have unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe issue of responsibility became even more complex when ChatGPT and other AI models started predicting and synthesizing content, blurring the lines between user inputs and AI-generated output. This ambiguity left the creators of the AI models in a position where they had to navigate the legal framework surrounding Section 230, wondering if their platforms were protected from liability for AI-generated content.\n\nIn conclusion, the development and use of AI models like ChatGPT brought both excitement and apprehension. The creators, tasked with supervising their systems, had to grapple with the challenge of defining responsibility when AI's outputs varied from simply regurgitating information to synthesizing and potentially containing harmful content. The Communications Decency Act provided a basis for protection, but the evolving nature of AI and its role in content creation demanded further clarification and regulation.",
            "expected_output": "It doesn \u2019 t merely surface existing content , such as a tweet , video or website originally contributed by someone else , but rather writes a contribution of its own in real time .The law says a person or entity becomes liable if they \u201c develop \u201d content even \u201c in part .\u201d And doesn \u2019 t transforming , say , a list of search results into a summary qualify as development ?What \u2019 s more , the contours of every AI contribution are informed substantially by the AI \u2019 s creators , who have set the rules for their systems and shaped their output by reinforcing behaviors they like and discouraging those they don \u2019 t .Yet at the same time , ChatGPT \u2019 s every answer is , as one analyst put it , a \u201c remix \u201d of third - party material .The tool generates its responses by predicting what word should come next in a sentence based on what words come next in sentences across the web .And as much as creators behind a machine inform its outputs , so too do the users posing queries or engaging in conversation .All this suggests that the degree of protection afforded to AI models may vary by how much a given product is regurgitating versus synthesizing , as well as by how deliberately a user has goaded a model into producing a given reply .",
