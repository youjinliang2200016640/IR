AAS can significantly increase muscle mass and strength by:\n\n1. Stimulating muscle protein synthesis: AAS can promote the growth and repair of muscle tissue, leading to increased muscle mass.\n2. Reducing muscle breakdown: AAS can inhibit the breakdown of muscle tissue, allowing for greater muscle retention and growth.\n3. Enhancing muscle pump: AAS can increase blood flow to the muscles, leading to a greater influx of nutrients and oxygen, which can contribute to increased muscle growth.\n\nStudies have consistently shown that AAS use is prevalent in professional bodybuilding circles. For example, a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that 70% of professional bodybuilders admitted to using AAS at some point in their careers. Another study published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism found that 45% of competitive bodybuilders reported using AAS in the past year.\n\nIt's important to note that while AAS can significantly enhance muscle mass, they can also have serious health risks, including cardiovascular problems, liver damage, and testicular atrophy. Additionally, many professional bodybuilders have been disqualified from competitions or banned from the sport due to AAS use.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that some bodybuilders may achieve remarkable muscle mass through natural means, such as intense training, proper nutrition, and dedication.

            "actual_output": "The statement \"Bodybuilders have more muscular mass than is naturally possible thanks to anabolic steroids\" is generally true, but it is not universally accurate. Anabolic steroids do significantly contribute to increased muscular mass in bodybuilders. These drugs stimulate muscle growth by mimicking the effects of natural testosterone, allowing individuals to build muscle more rapidly and to a greater extent than what would be achievable through natural training alone.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all bodybuilders rely solely on steroids. Many follow intense workout regimens, proper nutrition, and supplementation to enhance their muscle development. Steroids are a performance-enhancing drug, and their use is illegal in many sports and competitions. Additionally, the long-term health risks associated with steroid use, such as liver damage, cardiovascular problems, and hormonal imbalances, should be considered.\n\nTherefore, while anabolic steroids play a significant role in the increased muscle mass of some bodybuilders, it's not accurate to generalize that all bodybuilders rely on them to achieve superhuman levels of muscularity. There are bodybuilders who compete and train naturally, showcasing impressive muscle development without the use of these substances.",

Some examples of bus companies include Greyhound, Megabus, FlixBus, and various regional or local transit agencies.\n\n2.

It is commonly used for tasks such as watering plants, washing vehicles, or connecting pipes. In the context of the statement, 'hose' is not a coherent adjective to describe bus companies.\n\nGiven the context, it is clear that the statement is nonsensical and does not hold any logical meaning. Therefore, the statement 'bus companies are hose.' is false.",

As a result, we can say that \"A member of parliament is Order\" could be interpreted as a member of parliament should adhere to and promote order within the parliamentary proceedings.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statement \"A member of parliament is Order\" can be considered true in the sense that a member of parliament should maintain order and adhere to the rules of the chamber. However, it should be noted that this statement is not universally true, as there may be instances where individual members of parliament do not comply with these expectations.",

            "actual_output": "The statement is partially true and partially false. It is true that bodybuilders do have more muscle mass than what is naturally possible for most people without the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), such as anabolic steroids. However, it should be noted that not all bodybuilders use steroids, and the extent to which steroids contribute to their muscle mass can vary.\n\nAnabolic steroids are synthetic versions of the naturally occurring hormone testosterone. Testosterone plays a crucial role in the development of muscle mass, as it stimulates protein synthesis, which is the process by which the body builds and repairs muscle tissue. When anabolic steroids are used, they increase the levels of testosterone in the body, which in turn accelerates muscle growth.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that not all bodybuilders use anabolic steroids or other PEDs. There are natural bodybuilders who rely on a combination of proper nutrition, rigorous training, and rest to achieve their physique goals. They may also use supplements, such as protein powders or amino acids, to support their training efforts, but these do not have the same muscle-building effects as anabolic steroids.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to acknowledge that using anabolic steroids, or any other PEDs, comes with significant health risks. These drugs can lead to a wide range of side effects, including liver damage, high blood pressure, heart problems, mood swings, and fertility issues. In addition to the health risks, using steroids is also illegal without a prescription and can result in severe legal consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement is partially true, as some bodybuilders do have muscle mass that surpasses what is naturally possible without the use of anabolic steroids. However, not all bodybuilders rely on steroids to achieve their physique goals, and it is crucial to highlight the health risks and ethical issues associated with the use of PEDs.",

Anabolic steroids, also known as performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), can significantly enhance muscle mass and strength in athletes and bodybuilders. They do this by stimulating the body's production of hormones like testosterone, which is responsible for muscle growth.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the extent of muscle gain from anabolic steroids can vary greatly among individuals. Some bodybuilders may experience dramatic increases in muscle mass, while others may not see such a significant impact or may even have negative side effects. The effectiveness and response to steroids can also depend on factors like genetics, training, diet, and the specific steroid used.\n\nAdditionally, the use of anabolic steroids without proper medical supervision and training can lead to health complications, including liver damage, suppressed testosterone production (when one comes off the drugs), and potential withdrawal symptoms. Many professional bodybuilders and organizations have strict regulations against the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and most athletes seek to build muscle through natural means, such as rigorous training and a balanced diet.\n\nIn summary, while anabolic steroids can contribute to increased muscle mass, it's not accurate to say that bodybuilders have more than is \"naturally possible\" without considering the individual context and potential risks involved.",
