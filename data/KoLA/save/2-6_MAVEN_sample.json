            "actual_output": " The Radical War or Scottish Insurrection of 1820 refers to a series of events that took place in Edinburgh and surrounding areas in the spring of 1820. The insurrection was a series of strikes, riots, and other forms of unrest that arose out of the accumulation of grievances among workers and artisans in Scotland, particularly in Edinburgh, who were seeking reform of the British political system. \n\nOne of the most significant events during the Radical War was the decision by the Edinburgh Tradesmen to join the strikes and walk out of work on March 18, 1820. This walkout was in solidarity with the more radical demands of the Scottish radicals who were pushing for reform to the political system, including the right to vote and the abolition of the Poor Laws. On March 21, the Edinburgh mob marched on the Home of Parliament, the Old Town Hall, and petitioned for reform. The Home of Parliament was reluctant to address the demands of the mob, leading to the insurrection's climax on March 28, when the mob marched to the Tolbooth Prison, where radical leaders were being held, and demanded their release. The Home of Parliament responded by issuing the Edinburgh Review declaring against the radical demands, which further infuriated the crowd. The Home of Parliament then sent troops to the city to assist the local militia in suppressing the revolt, and a firefight ensued. Several people were killed and injured; several buildings were damaged; and the Home of Parliament was temporarily evacuated for safety.\n\nThe Radical War is significant for its place in the history of Scottish radicalism and its influence on the development of Scottish nationalism. It also demonstrates the ongoing resistance to the status quo in the face of political repression.",
