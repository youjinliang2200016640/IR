One way to do this is to use a loop to iterate over the characters in the string and check if each character is the start of an occurrence of the substring.

Then it checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If it is, then `n` is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, `n` is prime and the function returns `True`."}

{"task_id": "HumanEval/162", "solution": "To implement the `string_to_md5` function, you can use the `hashlib` module in Python, which provides the `md5` function for generating MD5 hashes. Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef string_to_md5(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.\n    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.\n\n    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'\n    \"\"\"\n    if text == \"\":\n        return None\n    else:\n        md5_hash = hashlib.md5(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()\n        return md5_hash\n```\n\nThe `encode` method is used to convert the string to bytes in UTF-8 encoding before passing it to the `md5` function, because the `md5` function only accepts bytes as input. The `hexdigest` method is then used to convert the MD5 hash from its binary representation to a hexadecimal string.\n\nYou can test the function with the example provided in the prompt:\n\n```python\n>>> string_to_md5('Hello world')\n'3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'\n```"}
