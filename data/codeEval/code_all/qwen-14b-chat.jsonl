Next, we initialize an empty list called `result` to store the words that meet the criteria.\n  3. We then iterate over the words in the list using a `for` loop.\n  4. For each word, we initialize a counter called `consonant_count` to keep track of the number of consonants in the word.\n  5. We then iterate over the characters in the word using a `for` loop. For each character, we check if it is a consonant by using the `isalpha` method to check if it is a letter, and then checking if it is not in the string \"aeiou\" (which contains all the vowels).\n  6. If the character is a consonant, we increment the `consonant_count` counter.\n  7. After we have checked all the characters in the word, we check if the `consonant_count` is equal to the desired number `n`. If it is, we add the word to the `result` list.\n  8.
